            "content": "<p>Fuchsia is lightweight operating system which is being developed by Google for making cross platform apps. The OS will not be based on Linux kernel and it is completely independent from android. Its kernel will be designed for only specific purpose and it is only possible by building the operating system on micro-kernel so Google has designed its own micro-kernel named <span class='boldText'>Magenta</span>.</p><img src='../images/fuchsia_os.png' class='centerdImages' alt='Fuchsia Operating System' /><p>Like embedded systems, mobile applications do not need to rely on complete OS for specific tasks to perform. Fuchsia will be considered as real-time operating system because it will be having the unified features of android OS and chrome OS.</p><h2>Why is it so lightweight?</h2><p>Google has already developed two operating systems, Android and Chrome OS, but both are based on Linux Kernel which follows modular monolithic approach. Linux kernel bears lots of issues like system is assembled from different component and these components work together reliably but processing becomes slow.</p><p>In <span class='boldText'>monolithic</span> type of architecture, all the basic services of operating system like management of memory, management of processes and handling the interrupts etc are packaged into a single module within the kernel space. This type of architecture leads to some serious drawbacks like huge kernel size, poor maintenance which means when there is a need to add some extra feature or fixing of bugs, the whole kernel needs to be recompiled again.<span class='boldText'>[3]</span></p><img src='../images/fuchsia_os_description.png' class='centerdImages' alt='Fuchsia Operating System' /><p><span class='boldText'>Micro-kernels </span>resolve the problem of growing size of kernels. In this type of kernel architecture, basic services of operating system like device driver management, protocol stack, file system etc. run into single user space. This reduces the code size of the kernel and also increases the security and stability of OS. Apart from this, if one of the basic services crashes or gets corrupted, other basic services would work properly. All the basic operating system services which are built-in part of the user space are made to run as servers which are used by other programs in the system through inter process communication (IPC).<span class='boldText'>[3]</span><p>Fuchsia OS utilizes the <span class='boldText'>Magenta</span> micro-kernel to control the most basic hardware functions by inter-process communication. Micro-kernels are better than monolithic kernels in terms of performance and process management. Magenta is built for modern computers, having fast processors, reduced amount of RAM and arbitrary peripherals doing open ended communication.<span class='boldText'>[3]</span></p><h2>The first look of Fuchsia smartphones</h2><p>Fuchsia interface and apps are written with <span class='boldText'>Google's Flutter SDK</span>. Flutter is mobile SDK which is used for building iOS and android applications from a single code base. It is like Google's widget framework for apps that is written in Dart which gives better performance from those most of the android applications which are written with java. Flutter's another design target is to provide high performance app which can run ideally 120 frames per second <span class='boldText'>[2]</span>.</p><img src='../images/fuchsia_os_first_ui.png' class='centerdImages' alt='Fuchsia Operating System User Interface' /><p>The User Interface of Fuchsia is called <span class='boldText'>Armadillo</span>. Armadillo interface is like series of cards on wide home screen which represent apps and fuchsia smart phones will be having only single home button which will work like window manager. Back and Recent app buttons will missing in these smart phones.<span class='boldText'>[5]</span></p><p>In the center there will be user's profile picture which can be tapped on and it will bring a menu that is like Android Quick Settings. The top row of icon shows battery percentage, network and cellular information. Below that, there will be slider consisting volume, brightness control and icons for airplane mode, do not disturb and orientation control.<span class='boldText'>[5]</span></p><p>Above the profile section, there is a bunch of cards which represents the set of apps that work together for the users to achieve a goal. Tapping on any card will load its full screen interface and the more interesting thing is split screen mode. In split screen mode, any card can be dragged into another card, can be placed anywhere on the screen horizontally as well as vertically by long pressing or user can have tab bar on top for all the applications that are dragged into one. By tapping on any tab, user can have full screen interface of particular selected application and again by clicking on home white circle button, home screen will appear with all the cards interfaces and that combined card interface. Swapping down from bottom list of suggestions card will appear and the bottom panel of screen consists Google search bar. Tapping on it will bring up a new customized keyboard which has a new dark theme similar to G-board. But it lacks lots of features like long pressing for symbols or setting do not work.<span class='boldText'>[5]</span></p><h2>Will Fuchsia Smart Phones Replace Android phones?</h2><p>Google’s Android platform has become so popular that it is difficult to imagine the future without it. However Android's Linux kernel is deteriorated with lots of issues, but it has covered all the market and people have become so used to it that they will find difficulty to adapt new OS in their smart phones.</p><p>Security is the biggest issue for all the operating systems including Linux. While Linux has good reputation than windows but from security point of view no operating system is perfect. Hundreds of devices cause fragmentation in android because these devices use twisted version of android. Google lends its OEM and carriers and permits other devices to modify accordingly. It too causes defragmentation in the android OS as the modifications cannot be promptly administered.<span class='boldText'>[4]</span></p><p>Another problem is update problem. Google releases new android updates annually and some tinkered devices don’t support updates so users with older version of android are not able to use new customized features of android updates.<span class='boldText'>[4]</span></p><p>These issues are perfectly resolved by a new OS as the resolutions provided by them are  not the part of the  expensive patent licenses. Fuchsia OS will be having a new updated customized widget framework. It won't need regular updates and it would be safer built and optimized for today. Google will solve all fragmentation and update problems in Fuchsia and it would gainfully work in different devices.</p><p>References :-</p><ul class='list listNumber' style='word-wrap:break-word;'><li><a href=' http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/google-fuchsia-project-independent-of-android-dave-burke-explains-1696783' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'> http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/google-fuchsia-project-independent-of-android-dave-burke-explains-1696783</a></li><li><a href='https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/software/a-modern-os-from-google' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/software/a-modern-os-from-google</a></li><li><a href=' http://www.go4expert.com/articles/operating-kernel-types-kernels-t24793/ ' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>http://www.go4expert.com/articles/operating-kernel-types-kernels-t24793/ </a></li><li><a href='http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/138518-google-fuchsia-os-what-s-the-story-so-far' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'> http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/138518-google-fuchsia-os-what-s-the-story-so-far</a></li><li><a href='https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/googles-fuchsia-smartphone-os-dumps-linux-has-a-wild-new-ui/' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'> https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/googles-fuchsia-smartphone-os-dumps-linux-has-a-wild-new-ui/</a></li></ul>",

            "content": "<p>In the era of the explosion of technologies, there is one that has caught eyes of the most, i.e “Internet of Things”, abbreviated as IoT. To begin with a brief introduction of what IoT is and how has it changed our way of living in the past and will keep influenced our lives, for all years to come.</p><h2>What is IoT?</h2><p>IoT, can be majorly understood as an ecosystem, where physical devices, implanted with sensors and connected to a Wi-Fi, can be accessed from anywhere through internet. As the name implies, “Internet of Things”, are all those “things”, which could be anything, (from an automobile, loaded with sensors, or a TV/AC remote, to a person with a health monitor of any kind), that are connected over internet, thus having the capability to collect/transfer data over the network, without any human intervention.</p><h2>Components that comprise the IoT ecosystem:</h2><p>IoT is not just about the physical devices, that can sense or affect the environment around, accessible through an application, but also involves a middleware, the IoT platform that bridges the two.  All the components must be closely bound into a unit by the network using wi-fi or wireless technology, some standards, and protocols that need to be followed to provide a ubiquitous system.</p><p class='boldText'>Following are the components that are required for an IoT ecosystem to flourish:</p><ul class='list'><li><span class='boldText'>Physical Objects loaded with sensors and actuators: </span>They are the things that sense the physical environment around them to function accordingly (sensors) or affect the environment (actuators).</li><li><span class='boldText'>Virtual Objects: </span>As the name suggests, objects like the e-tickets, agendas, wallets, books etc. that lay the base for connecting the physical devices to other components.</li><li><span class='boldText'>People: </span>The people that control the environment, using sensors or actuators on those physical devices, via mobile applications.</li><li><span class='boldText'>Services: </span>Services such as cloud services, is valued for processing massive chunks of data, or big data, into valuable information, to build or to run applications that are loaded to be run by people. These are also responsible for optimizing business processes, which is done by integrating the data of the devices.</li><li><span class='boldText'>IoT Platforms: </span>As mentioned above, IoT platform is the middleware that connects the IoT components, the physical objects, people, services etc to IoT. It not only provides access to the device but also ensures that the installation and the behavior of the device are proper. It also analyzes the data and provides interoperable connection to the cloud, local network, and other devices.</li><li><span class='boldText'>Networks: </span>All these mentioned components cannot function as required unless tied to the network, be it wireless or wireline technology, standards and protocols to be followed for the provision of a system that is pervasive.</li></ul><img src='../images/internet_of_things.png' class='centerdImages' alt='Internet of Things Ecosystem' /><p style='text-align:center;font-weight:600;'>Internet of Things Ecosystem</p><p style='text-align:center;'>Image Credit: Business Insider</p><h2>IoT Application Development:</h2><p>There was a time when IoT programming languages used to be unique to embedded systems, but with time, the software has moved on to use languages that are more practical, are known and in use by web developers. To choose the language apt for the development, there are a few things that are needed to be considered.</p><p>IoT comprises of embedded systems that have much limitations to consider, that are storage, low processing power and the small amount of RAM. These limitations make Linux or UNIX-like OSs like Ubuntu Core or Android, the most commonly used Operating System.</p><p>Similarly, to select a language for developing IoT applications, one has to opt for a language based on factors like compatibility with the IoT ecosystem, requirements like that of efficiency or speed, the size and the memory the code acquires, or even the speed of development of the app. IoT programming languages serve a wide range from general purpose languages to embedded specific. Though <a href='http://www.newgeninfinite.com/insights/blog/9-things-java-developer-should-know' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()'>Java covers a majority of the arena</a>, Python, C, JavaScript or other frameworks are no less catching up.</p><p>Below are the few of the languages that have occupied the market:</p><ul class='list'><li><span class='boldText'>C and C++: </span>As it goes in the past, C was born into embedded systems, by programming telephones switches, so it is certainly apt for developing IoT apps too. With its own handful of advantages and disadvantages, C is still most popular with developers.  Being one of the most transparent ones makes it the best choice for writing code on the lowest level of software, or even the hardware they are running on.</li><li><span class='boldText'>Java: </span>Java becomes a better choice over C, because the code is lesser hardware specific, which makes it more portable, as it claims “Write once, run everywhere”.  JVM provides the facility to move the code to not only smart phones or servers but even to the smallest of a chip. Java only requires a few libraries to make the base code run on any hardware.</li><li><span class='boldText'>Python: </span>What started as a scripting language, Python has become the “go-to” language for many developers. Python developers have also laid their hands on embedded control and IoT world.  With devices having enough memory and computational power, like the Raspberry pi processor, Python becomes the prime choice for handling applications with heavy data.</li><li><span class='boldText'>Javascript and Node.js: </span>Surprisingly, as JavaScript is finding its way to the server, it has also become a popular choice for IoT. Even, Node.js is widely being used for IoT,  as it can run on both embedded systems and even the server side software that’s powering the app. JavaScript is also used in the form of DeviceJS , which is a JS based development platform for programming sensors and controlling devices.</li></ul><h2>Future Plans of Developing Framework for IOT App Development:</h2><p>Through the article, we learnt that IoT domain is actually an amalgamation of domains that already existed, like that of Wireless Sensors and actuators and Pervasive Computing. However, with time, things have been evolving, and newer interaction patterns are emerging, and that is leaving the developers with challenges in reusing and combining existing approaches.</p><p>This calls for a need of development of an application development framework for developing IoT applications, which might use and adapt the existing domains. This can be achieved by following quite effectively:</p><ul class='list'><li><span class='boldText'>Developing a domain specific language: </span>To develop a framework, the pre-requisite is to model the devices being used in more generalised classes, unlike those found in present frameworks  and toolkits, as these primarily focus on specialized (WSAN and pervasive) subclasses of such devices.</li><li><span class='boldText'>Adapting toolkits to a more General class of devices:  </span>An existing toolkit for either WSANs or Pervasive systems needs to be modified, on the basis of the model obtained above, to support both Pervasive and WSAN nodes, and possibly even other classes of devices. In the event that this is not possible, a new toolkit needs to be developed.</li><li><span class='boldText'>Developing Abstractions for Incorporating Existing Internet Components into systems: </span>From the various definitions of the Internet of Things, it is clear that existing internet components, especially Web Services, have a role to play in this domain. Techniques need to be developed for interacting with such existing systems, employing techniques like client generation for SOAP web service based on WSDL.</li><li><span class='boldText'>Integrating Dynamic Discovery of Devices and Services: </span>An IoT framework should allow for a system to evolve at runtime. Approaches that allow for dynamic detection of heterogeneous devices and their services need to be investigated and implemented in the framework.</li></ul><p>References: <span class='boldText'>[1]</span> <a href='http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-the-internet-of-things-definition-2016-8?IR=T' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-the-internet-of-things-definition-2016-8?IR=T</a></p>",

The biggest problem with Java is that Java is old, wordy and error-prone. Although Java 8 was a big step in this direction, which includes various features, but android does not use all the features of Java 8. Android developers still use Java 7 or 6 for development. So a new language came into the world of Android, Kotlin. Kotlin has been developed by JetBrains, the same company which created one of the most popular IDE IntelliJ IDEA as well as the Android Studio. It is an open-source, statically typed language.</p><img src='../images/kotlin.png' class='centerdImages' alt='Android app development with Kotlin' /><h2>Why Kotlin?</h2><p>There are so many languages that compile to Java bytecode, but there are certain reasons which make Kotlin different from the others.</p><ul class='list'><li><span class='boldText'>Interoperability</span><p>One of its greatest strengths is that we can call java code from Kotlin or vice-versa. It is 100%  interoperable with Java. Both of them can be used side by side within the same project. We can also use Java libraries and frameworks within the Kotlin code.</p></li><li><span class='boldText'>Support for Android Studio</span><p>Android Studio is based on IntelliJ IDE and has full support for Kotlin. We just need to install the Kotlin plugins, and it will be configured in your project.</p><img src='../images/android_studio.png' class='centerdImages' alt='Support for Android Studio' /><p style='text-align:center;font-weight:600;'>Source Credit: code.tutsplus.com</p><p>The studio will also provide debugging, full refactoring, auto-completion, code navigation and unit testing support for Kotlin.</p></li><li><span class='boldText'>More concise code</span><p>The code is more compact and succinct than the one written in Java. So, it will take less time to read and less error- prone. Taking example of a java OnClick listener:-</p><code><pre>View.setOnClickListener(new view.OnClickListener(){<br/>   //@override<br/>  public void onClick(View v)<br/>  {<br/>    // android click listener<br/>  }<br/>});</pre></code><p>Equivalent code in Kotlin will be :</p><code><pre>View.setOnClickListener {<br/>  // Kotlin click listener<br/>}</pre></code></li><li><span class='boldText'>Safety from NullPointerExceptions</span><p>The most common cause of crashes in android is the NullPointerException. In Java, we have to guard our code everywhere from NPE by null check which is a very time-consuming task. With Kotlin, we don't need to worry about NPEs because a Kotlin type system is aimed to eliminate it. It is better to catch all the NPEs at compile time than crashing the app at runtime. For example, in Kotlin, all the variables are not null by default,  and if you want to define a nullable variable, then you’ll have to mark it with “?”. Suppose you have a string variable and you want to assign it a null value, then compiler throws an error.</p><p><code>var stringMessage: String stringMessage=null</code></p><p>The above statement fails to compile. If you want to define a nullable variable, you will have to tell it explicitly to the compiler.</p><p><code>var stringMessage: String? stringMessage=null</code></p><p>Now, it would work fine. Still, you should be careful while accessing this.</p><p>Every language has its own pros and cons. Kotlin is not different from others. Since, it is a new language, its community is small as compared to Java.</p></li></ul>",

Mobile vision library can find objects in photo and videos, using real-time on-device vision technology. It consists of 3 major APIs Face API, Text API, Barcode API. By using Face API we can detect and track the face and the face landmark like eyes, nose, and mouth in photo, video and live streaming. This library is available for both iOS and Android.</li><li><span class='boldText'>Core Image - </span>It is a computer vision framework for iOS. Core image can find face in image and it can also track faces in live streaming/ Video. It performs face detection not face recognition. Using this library we can find position of eye and mouth. This is only available for iOS v5.0 and later.<p><span class='boldText'>Note: </span>Google Mobile Vision performs face recognition while Core Image only does face detection.</p></li><li><span class='boldText'>Apple’s Speech Framework - </span>It is a speech recognition framework for iOS.

            "content": "<p>Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) is the new provider of the cryptocurrencies in exchange of other cryptocurrencies with great monetary benefits. It is a new money instrument to mine out the bitcoin-like currency. As a money instrument, ICOs or cryptocurrency exchanger is liked by the investors because it has no central datahouse which can readily get affected and it has a transparent working strategy which is widely accepted by the investors. The other concept enatils the raising of crowdfunding by the entrepreneurs for their projects using these cryptocurrencies or tokens. These tokens are not of actual currency in nature, but they can be turned into one, by exchanging their cryptotokens with other cyptocurrencies with better exchange values.</p><h2>Budding Interest of Venture Capitalists – First Neglected, Now Following</h2><p>Venture capitalists never believed in the dynamism of Initial Coin Offerings and kept on neglecting it till the market made them realize the potential. The reason behind such attitude was regular uncertainty, over evaluations and high valuations. The ICO is designed to earn more by exchanging with different tokens whenever needed. Some of the benefits offered by ICOs to the VC are as follows:</p><ul class='list'><li><span class='boldText'>Exponential Returns: </span>In 2016, Bitcoin start-up companies like NEM and Monero have witnessed 2000% increase in the value. Thus, their crowdfunding enhanced and the company utilized its fund for its growth.</li><li><span class='boldText'>Cryptocurrrency's Liquidity: </span>No lock-in period of the investment for the longer period. This is the concept of liquidity. Similarly, the investor can pull the funds from the start-up without waiting for the longer periods. In such case, the investor has to get the crytocurrency converted into the bitcoin or Ether, which can later be converted to the fiat currency by the online services.</span></li><li><span class='boldText'>Assured Returns: </span>Venture capitalists don't invest in start-ups till they gain some confidence on the strategy carved for the crowdfunding and their reclaimant over the invested money should not be denied. If they feel that the investment is getting better than the capital, they are free to pull the funds by simply exchanging it with a cryptocurrency which is exchanged with the fiat currency.</li><li><span class='boldText'>No Threats of Cyber Assault or Ransomware: </span>Since ICOs are not centrally administered, so there is no threat to the investments made by the investors. The private key is always with the investor which can be utilized to feed more investments in the start-up and can also be used to pull the funds whenever required. No external threat or software can take control over the network as every node is independent under the decentralized network.</li></ul><h2>Let Us Talk about ICOs Working</h2><p>The venture capitalists are always keen to learn the way the ICO works. The working of ICO is quite interesting as it is born hybrid with characters of crowdfunding, software token and user speculations. Any ICO works as follows:</p><img src='../images/venture_capital.png' class='centerdImages' alt='Why is Venture Capital Industry Sprinting to opt ICO?' width='500' height='auto'/><p><span class='boldText'>For instance: </span>Two Australian blockchain-powered platforms – Incent and Chronosbank <span class='boldText'>[1]</span> have successfully raised the crowd funding of $1 million and $7 million in six months without a requirement of the venture capital. It can be better understood as a start-up which starts with $10 million and raises to $ 100 billion in a short time. Mathematically, the ratio comes out to be 10000:1. As a decentralized network, every node is an equity holder and is accountable to raise the value of the network. The entire capacity depends upon the design and security of the smart contracts.</p><h2>Future Coin holds Lot More</h2><p>At present, the <a href='http://www.newgeninfinite.com/our-offerings/our-expertise/blockchain-development/' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()'>blockchain technology</a> is in a cradle as the internet was in the early 1900s. The upcoming technical improvizations in the blockchain technology shows the early arrival of the new possibilities which will add value to the other domains like health, finance, education, music and, others.</p><p>VC doubts the value of ICOs not on the account of money generation, but on the generation of crowdfunding and funding of the startup projects with it. However, for the existence in the market, it is necessary for the Venture Capitals to change the conventional ideology and enter into the era of the new technology of cryptocurrencies– ICO.</p><p>References: <span class='boldText'>[1]</span> <a href='http://www.afr.com/technology/venture-capital-30-the-initial-coin-offering-explained-20170502-gvxhos' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()'>http://www.afr.com/technology/venture-capital-30-the-initial-coin-offering-explained-20170502-gvxhos</a></p>",

With growing popularity it has more and more community support.</li><li>Another very good feature of React is the readability of the source code unlike Angular or any other platform. It makes developer’s life very easy especially in those applications where longer support cycles are required.</li><li>With React you have luxury to render your components on client side as well as server side so for specific needs you can choose any type of rendering depending upon what suits your requirement best.</li><li>React manage its own virtual DOM where all user developed components reside. It boosts the performance and gives ultimate flexibility to developers. React continuously watch for the changes in virtual DOM and pass on these changes in browser DOM very efficiently which is usually a costly operation.</li><li>Due to its support of server side rendering React makes SEO process very easy and efficient in comparison to other popular Java Script frameworks. There is no need of SEO specific handling like using Phantom and crawler submission etc.</li><li>React uses JSX which is a unique syntax made of JavaScript and HTML combined. However this is not mandatory to use JSX, still you can write your JavaScript and HTML separately but using JSX is highly recommended. As a result of that you might see its learning curve slightly steep but still simple than Angular or Backbone etc.</li><li>React provides some out of the box developer tools which can make developers life quite easy. One just need to install React.js Chrome Extension and it makes debugging very easy. Even you can directly look into virtual DOM and browse your elements.</li></ul>",

            "content": "<h2>Current Business Situation</h2><p>Smartphones have become very widespread and have claimed an important role in the way people are accessing information. Mobile traffic has been growing 1.5 times annually over the course of last 5 years and the trend is likely to continue or even accelerate.</p><p>According to The Cisco Visual Networking Index (VNI) Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast, global mobile data traffic grew 74 percent in 2015, to 3.7 exabytes per month and expected to reach 30.6 exabytes by 2020. Mobile data traffic has grown 4,000-fold over the past 10 years and almost 400-million-fold over the past 15 years. Average Smartphone usage grew 43 percent in 2015. Smartphones will reach 66 percent of mobile data traffic by 2018.</p><p>In an effort to make Smartphones smarter, efficient and optimized, a lot of research and effort is going on considering the measurement of energy use, computation offload and usage. However, understanding the importance or effectiveness of these contributions is difficult due to the lack of detailed data about how Smartphones are actually used.</p><p>Currently mobile analytics relies on events defined by developers, for example screen views or user demographics. Analytics session such as ‘Google analytics’ rely on activities limited to specific application but doesn’t provide overall phone usage and user’s experience with Smartphones across all mobile applications.</p><h2>Profiling Smartphone Usage</h2><p>Smartphones are highly capable computing devices containing a variety of embedded sensors, which are widely used in mobile and ubiquitous computing, including location systems, measurement and context sensing.</p><p>Access to these sensory data can enable us to recognize different activities, events or actions that can be ‘sensed’ by a mobile app using inertial sensors such as accelerometers or gyroscopes. Activity recognition tries to classify physical activities carried out by a person whether the user is walking, driving, or holding the device to his ear, watching video, is at rest/idle and so on.</p><h2>Unleashing CEP & MQTT</h2><p><span class='boldText'>Complex Event Processing </span>is about listening to streams of information (events) and detecting patterns in real-time, without having to store events. CEP can combine data from multiple sources and identifies the most meaningful events within the event cloud, filters and analyzes them by conditions, and acts on them in real-time.</p><p>With a detecting-oriented CEP solution to analyze continuous sensors data from all the connected Smartphone devices in secure network, it enables us to recognize different activities the user is performing on their respective Smartphones and henceforth how the device is getting used throughout. This CEP Solution focuses on executing on-line algorithms as a response to sensor data entering the system and classifies the activities.</p><p>For connecting Smartphones, MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) provides wireless lightweight medium to transmit data and simple push messaging capability.</p><img src='../images/android.png' class='centerdImages' alt='Understanding Smartphone usage with MQTT/ Android' /><h2>Component 1: MQTT Client Android Application</h2><p>An android application which takes advantage of built-in Smartphones sensors such as gyroscope and accelerometer, to collect sensor data in the background after initial setup even when user is not actively using the device. Data is then broadcasted every second (which can be easily configured). This mobile application consumes low processor as well as battery resource and doesn’t impact user experience. Also, it doesn’t require any registration or access to user’s sensitive data.</p><p>It utilizes MQTT messaging protocol to publish sensor information at configurable interval data from “client” devices, to an MQTT broker connected over a secure wireless network. Broker can handle up to thousands of concurrently connected MQTT clients and is responsible for receiving and filtering all the messages.</p><h2>Component 2: MQTT Broker & CEP Tool</h2><p>The server on the other end receives the broadcasted messages by all the clients, process them in real time with CEP tool and crafts the usage of all subscribed Smartphones averaged out over last 3 seconds hopping window. The data will enter the system at the rate of 10,000 events per second, with each event holding sensor data of connected devices.</p><h2>Component 3: User intuitive dashboard</h2><p>Users are provided with intelligent and contextual information in real time dashboard in order to make timely decisions. Users are enabled with flexibility to determine what events are monitored, how events are analyzed, and how responses should be activated. Dashboard provides comprehensive management & monitoring Web console that enables fine grained control for user to filter relevant information based on specific user, time duration ranging from an hour to weeks. Also it allows the user to generate reports and identify behavioral patterns.</p><p>In addition, sensor data can be further stored and analyzed to determine behavioral patterns on phone usage over the course of time based on the algorithm.</p><img src='../images/iot.png' class='centerdImages' alt='IOT data Analysis'/><h2>Reference</h2><a href='http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/mobile-white-paper-c11-520862.html' rel='nofollow'  class='internalLinkColor'>http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/mobile-white-paper-c11-520862.html</a>",

            "content": "<p>There are numerous challenges or common mistakes we did when we start writing JavaScript. Few of them are:</p><ul class='list'><li>Global namespace/Scope variables issues</li><li>Mistakes with semicolon</li><li>Hard to find what \"this\" keyword return</li><li>Use of reserved keywords unknowingly</li><li>Inconsistent behaviour with \"typeof\" ....... and many more</li></ul><p>Regardless of all these it still a very popular language and every developer should learn it but we need to be very good at it to create the bug free and reliable code because the harsh reality is we developers make frequent mistakes while writing the JavaScript especially when we are in the middle of deadline and at the end we tied up in the middle of nothing and only hope left is to rewrite the logic because of so many runtime errors and hard to debug.</p><p>That brings in the Typescript which focuses on providing useful tools for large scale applications by implementing features such as interfaces, classes, static typing, inheritance, modules and many more. It's a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles into plain JavaScript. Many of us can compare it with JQuery but it must be clear that JQuery is strictly a JavaScript library which help us to easily write some complex methods in JavaScript. Jquery is just a method library completely written in JavaScript and Typescript is a language and the code is compiled in JavaScript by the typescript compiler. It means that introducing the Typescript to your current JavaScript code is easy, just rename the .js file to .ts file and we are good to go.</p><img src='../images/typescript.jpg' alt='Typescript: The Awesome Way to Write Javascript' class='centerdImages'><p>We can install/setup the typescript according to platforms we work and requirements. Visual Studio 2015 comes up with typescript and plugins available for other versions. The new open source <a href='http://www.newgeninfinite.com/insights/blog/visual-studio-code-analysis' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()'>Visual Studio Code IDE</a> also have the typescript in built. For other platform all we need is text editor and Typescript npm package and of course browser to run.</p><p class='boldText'>Let discuss some of the awesome features Typescript have:</p><ul class='list'><li>Static typing: It's make JavaScript very flexible but also very error prone. Typescript introduces the concept of static typing where developer can define variables with its type same as we create in any server side languages like C#, JAVA etc. If we don't assign the data type, the typescript tries its best to assign its data type based on whatever the variable is assigned to. So if any how you are assigned the value of different data type the compiler will give you the error/warning.<br><br>Its depends on the what IDE you are using it can also give you intellisense hints like in Visual Studio XXXX or Visual Studio Code.</li><li>Type Annotation: It's an optional feature which allows us to check the program strictly at compile time. If we pass or assign any incorrect type of values to function parameter or variable it will give you compile time error. This feature is extremely helpful while building large scale and diverse applications.</li><li>Classes: Typescript support classes and it closely follows the ECMAScript 6 with accessibility modifiers.</li><li>Inheritance: Typescript supports inheritance the same way any server side coding language such that any subclass or derived class that is defined can inherit the definitions of base class.</li></ul><p>To understand the features of Typescript in depth, please start with this best tutorial and start writing a JavaScript in object oriented way which is more familiar to us just like any server side language.</p><p></p><a href='https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/tutorial.html' rel='nofollow'>",

Everyone appreciates a good product, whether in terms of hardware or software.</p><h2>Who is responsible for quality?</h2><p>Quality Assurance (QA) team, it’s right in their name.<br>We all know this is not the right answer. Everyone has their role to play in ensuring quality.</p><p>Quality standards must be baked in from the beginning. QA cannot add quality to the code at the end.</p><h2>How one can maintain a good quality product?</h2><p>A lot of suggestions like following coding standards, latest design patterns, performing code analysis, unit testing, integration testing, etc. will come.</p><p>Code reviews often do not get recognized as part of development activity in agile methodology, people might skip this activity in case of tight deadlines. I think sooner or later it pays to write good quality code.</p><h2>How to ensure that you are writing good code?</h2><p>First of all, it’s the developer's job. Everyone can write code. Google, StackOverflow, CodeProject, Github, etc. have been really helpful.  After writing, code review starts with developer testing their own code. They are responsible for the code they write. It is most easily done when the code is fresh in mind. Sometimes, change might seem trivial, but it should be tested before submitting.</p><p>If find yourself asking <span class='boldText'>“do I really need to test this change”?</span><br>A senior developer in my company used to say:<span class='boldText'> Every path. Every line. Every time</span></p><h2>How you can test your code?</h2><p>There are different types of developer testing which might apply to some code and not to others.</p><p><span class='boldText'>Desk Checking:</span> Before submitting your code, walk through your code and make sure your code changes makes sense. Try to put yourself in code reviewer's shoes, see it from his perspective. Make sure all the standard patterns and coding guidelines are followed.</p><p><span class='boldText'>Manual Testing:</span> You should be using a debugger to step through all of your code changes, making sure to exercise all logical paths. The next important thing is to make sure unit tests are created in your code. It will also help to debug through all your code changes. Also, make sure your code is working in an integrated environment.</p><p><span class='boldText'>Automated Testing:</span> This type of testing could ensure that your changes do not break any existing code. It will also help in reducing the turnaround time to successfully complete your tasks. Manually testing will definitely take too long, as compare to automated testing. Common types of automated testing:<ul class='list'><li>Unit testing: For testing individual unit of code and making sure all the unit test cases are getting executed successfully.</li><li>Integration testing: For testing components or units of code to verify interactions between them.</li></ul></p><p><span class='boldText'>Build Testing:</span> In order to perform above types of testing, your code must build. You should always build in clean environment.</p><p>Apart from developer testing, Code Reviews are the best way to ensure that all code is of high quality is to perform code reviews. There are few types of code review practices that we can use depending on the situation:</p><h2>Self Driven Code Reviews:</h2><ul class='list listStyleTypeNone'><li><span class='boldText'>What: </span>Any and all the changes</li><li><span class='boldText'>When: </span>Before submitting your code for peer or group review.</li><li><span class='boldText'>Who: </span>You (Code author)</li><li><span class='boldText'>Why: </span>Avoid errors and your co-workers time.</li><li><span class='boldText'>How: </span>Perform Desk checking.

            "content": "<p>Angular js is a framework which is based on javascript. Now, Since it’s a framework so it sets some standards to be followed and if you follow those standards you can take advantages of several inbuilt unique features of Angular. So let’s very quickly take a look at <span class='boldText'>some of those unique features of Angular</span>.</p><img src='../images/angular_framework.png' alt='Angular and its Unique Features'><p><span class='boldText'>Templating Engine: </span>Templating lets you write special tags in the code and at run-time these tags are replaced by the actual data. Now the good news is that the templating engine is inbuilt in the Angular framework itself so you need not be dependent on any third party templating engine. Also, Angular allows you to write a template as part of your HTML so there is no need to write a separate template and then referencing it back.</p><p><span class='boldText'>Handling of DOM events: </span>Now another great feature of Angular is the way it interacts with HTML Document object Model or DOM. In traditional Applications, you have to worry about checking for event triggers but Angular takes care of it automatically so you can completely focus on the core logic of your application.</p><p><span class='boldText'>MVC Architecture: </span>Moving on to the next feature, Angular supports object oriented programming structure in the form of MVC. With this MVC architecture you can compare any traditional MVC architecture application but the only difference is that in case of Angular all the three components of MVC that is Model, View and Controller, exist on client side only.</p><p><span class='boldText'>Directives: </span>Directives are nothing but commands in HTML. These commands simply tell Angular to do its job. There are several in-built directives in Angular which you can use directly and at the same time you can create your own customized directives and use them throughout the application. This is also a classic example of code reusability.</p><p><span class='boldText'>Modules: </span>Now another good feature that I really like in Angular is Modules. Instead of writing single gigantic javascript file you can divide your code in different -2 modules based on your functionality and these modules can refer each other just like you do in any traditional OOPS based programme. Angular supports Dependency injection which further support plugin/plug out modular structure.</p><p><span class='boldText'>Testing Ready: </span>Moving on to the last feature I want to talk about testing. Angular allows you or rather enforces you to write code which can be tested using Angular supported frameworks like Karma or Jasmine. Is it not great?</p><p>Apart from the ones I just discussed there are several other exciting features like two-way Data binding, Filters, Routes that can make your life easy as an architect and developer.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Hybrid - term is derived from Combination of multiple things. As its name says Hybrid Application is the application which can run on multiple platforms using single code base. Hybrid mobile application combination of both Native & Web Applications. A native application is developed using the specific language for specific platform e.g Objective C or Swift for iOS App development & Java for Android etc. Whereas Web Applications are a browser-based application which run on device browser. The web applications use only browser engine to run & don’t install on Local Device storage.</p><p>Hybrid application uses the feature of Native & Web Application. Unlike Web application it installs on the local storage of Device & can also run with Internet Connection & access device-level features. You don’t need specific domain knowledge to develop each platform application which is a limitation of Native App.</p><p>So, if I want to develop an Application which will run on iOS/Android/Windows then in the case of native application development my effort & time will be high as it need to write same application in three different domain language whereas, if one choose hybrid app the effort & time will be only one time for all platform(iOS/Android/Windows).</p><h2>How it Works?</h2><p>There are multiple tools & frameworks available in the market like Ionic, Sencha Touch etc. But most of the hybrid app development framework work on top of Cordova platform.</p><p>Cordova is an Apache based open-source mobile development framework which provides ease of using standard web technologies(HTML/JS) for cross-platform development. So one can use any Javascript framework(like angular, backbone etc) to develop the application.</p><p>A hybrid application uses webView to render the application, this is the place where HTML/JS code renders & executes, and the difference is instead of device browser it runs inside the application itself.</p><p>The following figure will give you more idea of any Cordova-based hybrid applications.</p><img src='../images/cordova.png' alt='Cordova Apache Website'><p>Now, one question will come into mind that if the application is written in HTML/JS then how  will it access device hardware(Camera, compass, GPS etc)? Now, this is where Cordova plugins come into the scene. Cordova plugins are the integral part of the Cordova ecosystem. They provide an interface for Cordova & native components to communicate with each other and bindings to standard device APIs, which enable you to invoke native code from Javascript.</p><h2>Pros</h2><ul class='list'><li>One code base for all platforms. The development time effort is reduced as single code base work for all devices and platforms whether iOS, Android, Windows, FireOS etc.</li><li>Web application can easily migrate into Mobile App.</li><li>One can access native functionality of device like native App.</li></ul><h2>Cons</h2><ul class='list'><li>Not all the native functionalities can be used in hybrid as it depends on Plugin availability. One can write its own cordova plugin but he/she might have good knowledge of native application code.</li><li>Performance of hybrid is little bit slower than native as there is layer between device OS & applications, whereas in native all native OS components are used to develop the app.</li></ul><h2>Tools/Framework</h2><p>Following are the popular tools/frameworks for Hybrid Mobile Development:</p><ul class='list'><li>Ionic 1/2</li><li>PhoneGap</li><li>Intel XDK</li><li>OnSen UI</li><li>Sencha Touch</li><li>Appcelerator Titanium</li></ul><p>Most of the tools like Ionic, PhoneGap etc work on top of Cordova, and each tool provides some add-on functionality on the top of Cordova like IDE integration, Native look UI components, InBuilt Angular integration etc.</p>",

            "content": "<h2>Are you curious about Blockchain technology?</h2><p>Most of the people think Blockchain as an innovative and game-changing technology. But if you haven't heard about Blockchain technology, then I'm pretty sure that you know something about Bitcoin or cryptocurrency. Blockchain came into existence with its first use case - Bitcoin. Bitcoin is basically a decentralized peer-to-peer cryptocurrency. However, Blockchain technology is not just about the cryptocurrency. The blockchain is defined as a shared immutable ledger for recording all the transactions in the network. Blockchain can have public, private or consortium network. Blockchain was introduced with the goal of having decentralized financial system that establishes trust, accountability, and transparency in the system. We will talk about one of the fabled blockchain technology of today, Hyperledger.</p><p>Hyperledger is an open source collaborative effort by the Linux Foundation. Hyperledger is not a specific network, like Bitcoin, dedicated to financial transactions. It is actually a framework to run user specific networks adapted to their specific application. The aim of Hyperledger Project is to develop a flexible framework that can be configured to meet the specific requirements of each application. Hyperledger focuses on advancing industry goals of distributed ledger and smart contracts. Another way to consider it's potential role in the emerging landscape of blockchain technologies is as a permissioned distributed ledger. Blockchain technologies are mainly permissionless focusing on cryptocurrency to fund mining and participate in consensus. Let's get immersed in learning more about Hyperledger.</p><h2>What is Hyperledger Fabric?</h2><p>Hyperledger is an enterprise-grade blockchain fabric and distributed ledger framework, amalgamated with advanced architecture to deliver confidentiality, flexibility, scalability and resilience. Hyperledger is crafted to accommodate the sophistication and intricacies existing in economic ecosystem along with supportive pluggable implementations of varying components.</p><p>Hyperledger Fabric is not designed for the concept of cryptocurrency. Hyperledger Validating Peers (VPs) are not responsible for the mining and sharing of blocks between them. Take a look at how it works:</p><ul class='list'><li>A transaction is sent to one of the validating peers.</li><li>The validating peer broadcast the transaction to all other validating peers.</li><li>All validating peers reach consensus using PBFT algorithm to follow the execution of the transaction.</li><li>All validating peers execute the transaction on their own and these executed transactions are stored as hashes in the blocks.</li></ul><p>Raw transactions are permanently stored in the ledger. Authorized auditors and validators have rights to access encrypted confidential transactions, while non-confidential transactions are accessible by all participants.</p><p>Let's discuss the design features of hyperledger fabric model. The key design features include:</p><ul class='list'><li><span class='boldText'>Assets:</span> Assets are entities which can be anything ranging from tangible entities to intangible entities. Hyperledger fabric has the ability to use these assets as units in order to exchange them for transaction purpose.</li><li><span class='boldText'>Chaincode:</span> Chaincode is basically smart contract which defines the business logic of the application. It defines the assets and the transaction instructions for modifying those assets.</li><li><span class='boldText'>Ledger Features:</span> The ledger sequentially records the state transitions of the ledger. State transitions result from chaincode invocations submitted by participating parties. The shared ledger is immutable and can perform invoke and query operations same as database.</li><li><span class='boldText'>Privacy for Channels:</span> Channels have a high degree of privacy and confidentiality as it is used for exchanging assets on a common network.</li><li><span class='boldText'>Consensus:</span> Hyperledger uses Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm which is capable of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second. The surplus point is Hyperledger allows you to change the consensus algorithm.</li><li><span class='boldText'>Security & Membership Services:</span> Membership service provides a trusted permissioned based blockchain network where all the transactions are traced by authorized regulators and auditors. Membership service issues following certificates to peers:<ul class='list'><li><span class='boldText'>Enrollment Certificates:</span> E-Certs are issued by E-Certificate Authority who assign the identity to the node, gives permission to join and issue transactions.</li><li><span class='boldText'>Transactions Certificates:</span> T-Certs are issued by T-Certificate Authority in order to issue one or more transactions.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>System Architecture</h2><p>The blockchain is a distributed system containing multiple nodes that interact with each other. Hyperledger executes the chaincode programs, holds state and ledger data, and execute transactions. The system architecture of hyperledger fabric consist of three components:</p><ul class='list'><li><span class='boldText'>Transactions :</span>Transactions can be of two types:<ul class='list'><li><span class='boldText'>Deploy Transaction</span> is the transaction that executes new chaincode where the chaincode program is the parameter. When a deploy transaction executes successfully, the chaincode has been installed on the blockchain.</li><li><span class='boldText'>Invoke Transactions</span> are those transactions that perform operations in the context of deployed chaincode. Invoke transactions are executed in order to modify the state or data in the ledger.</li></ul></li><li><span class='boldText'>Blockchain Datastructures :</span> Blockchain data structures consist of:<ul class='list'><li>State can be stored as a key-value pair using RocksDB. It can be manipulated by the chaincode throughput and get operations. They are maintained by peers only, not by orderers and clients.</li><li>Ledger contains a chain of blocks which includes all the valid and invalid transactions in it in the form of hashes. Ledger is the sequential order of blocks where each block consists of an array of sequential transactions. They are kept by peers and a subset of orderers. On this basis, ledgers are of two types: PeerLedger and OrdererLedger. They differ from each other as PeerLedger maintains a bitmask that tells differentiate valid transactions from invalid ones.</li></ul></li><li><span class='boldText'>Nodes:</span> Nodes are the entities which are responsible for the communication purpose in the blockchain network. They are of three types:</li><ul class='list'><li>Clients are responsible for submitting an actual transaction invocation to the endorsers and broadcast transaction proposals to the ordering services.</li><li>Peers receive ordered state updates in the form of blocks from the ordering service and maintain the state and the ledger. They additionally take up a special role as an endorser by endorsing transaction before it is committed.</li><li>Ordering services or orderers provides a shared communication channel to clients and peers that provide delivery guarantees by offering broadcast service for messages containing transactions.</li></ul></ul><p>Now we have gained basic knowledge about hyperledger. Let's move ahead and get started with the smart contract part, i.e. chaincode.</p><h2>What is Chain code?</h2><p>Chaincode, also known by the name smart contract, is the business logic that governs how various assets can be used by different entities to transact in a blockchain network. Chaincode is basically the encapsulation of business network transactions in code. Chaincode can be written in Golang or Java, which runs inside a docker container. In this post, I’ll only talk about a basic overview of chaincode in Hyperledger. Let's take a close look at chaincode structure using Golang.<br>In order to execute the chaincode, it is required to import various dependencies:<ul class='list'><li>fmt - contains Println for debugging/logging.</li><li>error - standard go error format.</li><li>shim - contains the definitions for the chaincode interface and the chaincode stub, which are required to interact with the ledger.</li></ul></p><p>In order to run chaincode you need to implement the chaincode shim interface. Primarily, your chaincode constitutes of three methods that have same prototype and takes stub, a function name and an array of strings as parameters. the functions are defined below:</p><ul class='list'><li><span class='boldText'>Init() :</span> The Init method is used to initialize the hyperledger blockchain network. This method is called at the time of deployment of the chaincode. All the steps that need to be performed at the time of deployment are defined in this method.</li><li><span class='boldText'>Invoke() :</span> The invoke method includes a function name and an array of arguments in order to modify the state and data in the ledger. This method includes creating, update and delete operations for the ledger.</li><li><span class='boldText'>Query() :</span> The query method includes a function name and an array of arguments for querying operation that needs to be performed on the blockchain state. This method is not called in transactional context as it does not modify the state of the blockchain.</li></ul><p>After writing your chaincode, you need to first deploy the chaincode which will execute the init method of your chaincode and initialize your blockchain network and then only you will be able to perform the invoke and query requests on your blockchain network.<br>Interested enough???<br>Yeah!!! Start writing chaincode and develop your first hyperledger project. Hope you find it helpful.</p>",

            "content": "<p>It was my first day in the new organization and client assigned a task of setting up MySQL cluster. Truly speaking, I was speechless for a moment on hearing the term Cluster. I had never heard this term before. I was little upset on getting the task on the very first day. After doing research for some time, I found that there is an auto installer for MySQL but due to limited access on the systems and with antivirus installed, auto cluster did not work. Antivirus was actually blocking cluster startup. I researched more and found how to set up MySQL cluster manually. The cluster, that I designed, requires at least 4 machines in order to be highly available and fault tolerance cluster. At the end of the task, client was very happy and appreciated my work.</p><p>Database Clustering is a technique by which one or more servers or instances connect to a single database. A database is a set of physical files that actually store data and an instance is set of memory and processes that interact with these physical files. The term database clustering is bit ambiguous. Some people consider database cluster as two or more servers that share same storage while others consider database cluster to be a set of replicated servers. So, depending upon how data is stored and resources are allocated, clustering takes different forms.</p><p>One form is <span class='boldText'>Shared-Nothing Architecture</span> also known as <span class='boldText'>Database Sharding</span>. In Shared-Nothing Architecture, a cluster is made up of different nodes. Each node is fully independent of others. So, there is no single point of failure. An example of this type of cluster is an organization that has multiple data centers for a single website. In case, one data center is down, others can take over the charge and when the first data center is up, it updates itself with data from the other server.</p><p>Second form is <span class='boldText'>Shared-Architecture</span> in which data is stored centrally and then accessed by instances on different nodes or servers.</p><p>Following matrix shows the use cases of how cluster will behave when nodes are down. These use cases are based on a four-machine cluster.</p><table cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0'class='newgenTable'><tbody><tr><th>Use Case</th><th>Mgmt 1</th><th>Mgmt 2</th><th>data + sql node 1</th><th>data + sql node 2</th><th>Notes</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>up</td><td>up</td><td>up + up</td><td>up + up</td><td>cluster is active</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>down</td><td>up</td><td>up + up</td><td>up + up</td><td>cluster is active</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>up</td> <td>down</td><td>up + up</td><td>up + up</td><td>cluster is active</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>down</td><td>down</td><td>up + up</td><td>up + up</td><td>cluster is active</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>up</td><td>up</td><td>up+ up</td><td>down + up</td><td>cluster is active</td></tr><tr> <td>6</td><td>up</td><td>up</td><td>down + up</td><td>up+ up</td><td>cluster is active</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>up</td><td>up</td><td>up + down</td><td>down + up</td><td>cluster is active</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>up</td><td>up</td><td>down + up</td><td>up + down</td><td>cluster is active</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>up</td><td>up</td><td>up + down</td><td>up + up</td><td>cluster is active</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>down</td> <td>down</td><td>down + up</td><td>up + up</td><td><span class='boldText'>cluster is down.</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Here is a brief of how I set up the MySQL database cluster.</p><h2>Tools Used</h2><ul class='list'><li>Operating System: Windows 7 64 bit.</li><li>MySQL Cluster s/w download: Supported version of MySql cluster can be downloaded from <a href='javascript:void(0);' target='_blank'>http://www.mysql.com/downloads/cluster/</a>.

Someone else boots up the machine. If that person is not aware of running these commands, your node will still remain down.

Use below commands to configure nodes as windows service:</p><h4>ManagementNode1 As Windows Service</h4><pre><code>\"C:\\\\User1\\\\2MC\\\\mysqlc\\\\bin\\\\ndb_mgmd.exe\" --install=MGMD1 --config-file=\"C:\\\\User1\\\\2MC\\\\my_cluster\\\\conf\\\\config.ini\" --configdir=\"C:\\\\User1\\\\2MC\\\\my_cluster\\\\conf\"</code></pre><h4>ManagementNode2 As Windows Service</h4><pre><code>\"C:\\\\User1\\\\2MC\\\\mysqlc\\\\bin\\\\ndb_mgmd.exe\" --install=MGMD2 --config-file=\"C:\\\\User1\\\\2MC\\\\my_cluster\\\\conf\\\\config.ini\" --configdir=\"C:\\\\User1\\\\2MC\\\\my_cluster\\\\conf\"</code></pre><h4>DataNode1 As Windows Service</h4><pre><code>\"C:\\\\User1\\\\2MC\\\\mysqlc\\\\bin\\\\ndbd.exe\" --install=DataNode1 --ndb-connectstring=\"host=10.0.0.1:1186,10.0.0.2:1186\" --connect-retries=\"-1\"</code></pre><h4>DataNode2 As Windows Service</h4><pre><code>\"C:\\\\User1\\\\2MC\\\\mysqlc\\\\bin\\\\ndbd.exe\" --install=DataNode2 --ndb-connectstring=\"host=10.0.0.1:1186,10.0.0.2:1186\" â€“connect-retries=\"-1\"</code></pre><h4>SQL Node1 As Windows Service</h4><pre><code>\"C:\\User1\\2MC\\mysqlc\\bin\\mysqld.exe\" --install MySqld1 â€“defaults-file=C:\\User1\\2MC\\my_cluster\\conf\\my1.cnf</code></pre><h4>SQL Node2 As Windows Service</h4><pre><code>\"C:\\User1\\2MC\\mysqlc\\bin\\mysqld.exe\" --install MySqld2 â€“defaults-file=C:\\User1\\2MC\\my_cluster\\conf\\my2.cnf</code></pre>",

            "content": "<h2>Database Indexes to Rescue</h2><p>While working on one of those projects wherein our team of java developers was serving the role of DBA too, we fell into serious database performance crisis. Though our application worked just fine in development environment; it was quite slow for a few functionalities in the production like environment. Turned out that due to the bulk of data in production database, some queries were slow. As the release date was approaching, we did every effort to rewrite our queries in different ways to achieve no significant performance gain. This is when the indexes came to rescue. Database indexes are an efficient tool to enhance database performance. In this blog, I discuss how we can use database indexes to improve performance of our application's database. Though the discussed concepts apply to most of the relational databases, I have used MySQL for examples. At many places I have used the MySQL world database, available   <a href='http://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html' target='_blank'> <strong>here</strong></a>. </p> <h2> Understanding Indexes</h2><p>Database indexes are the data structures which facilitate fast lookup of rows from a table by maintaining a copy of indexed columns in a way that can be searched efficiently. Index entries also contain links to the corresponding rows in the table for actual row retrieval. A simple representation of the index is as shown below, though there would be some complex data structure (e.g., B-Tree, Hash, RTree etc.) actually implementing the index.</p><p><img alt='Database Index' src='../images/db_index_1.jpg' class='centerdImages'></p><p>In the absence of indexes, a table would be searched from beginning to the end to find the matching rows which has a time complexity of O(n). If the table contains a large number of rows this would lead to slow query execution. However, indexes on the search columns can make the query execution efficient e.g., a B-Tree based index would have a complexity of O(log(n)). You can compare database indexes with the real world book indexes or telephone directories. Imagine how difficult it would be to search a topic in a book without proper indexes. The same way all but very small databases would benefit with indexes. Like a normal telephone directory would only help search on the basis of name and not using a phone number; the same way an index would only speed up the query for indexed column and would not help for other columns. If you need to search on multiple columns you either need multiple indexes or composite indexes.</p><p>Indexes definitely improve the search on the indexed column however it does come with a cost. All the insert, delete and updates on the indexed column would now take a little more time as this would involve inserting, removing and updating entries in index too. Also, index would itself require some storage space increasing overall storage requirements of the database. So, one should use indexes wisely.</p><p>Below are a few examples of various possible ways to create indexes in MySQL:</p><p>1)Specify index in CREATE TABLE itself</p><pre><code>CREATE TABLE customer (\n     id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n     name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,\n     address VARCHAR(50),\nINDEX name_index (name(5) DESC))</code></pre><p>2)Using ALTER TABLE ADD INDEX to add index if the table already exists.</p> <pre><code>ALTER TABLE customer ADD INDEX name_index (name(5) DESC)</code></pre><p>3)Using CREATE INDEX ON</p><p>, when table already exists.</p><pre><code>CREATE INDEX name_index ON customer (name(5) DESC)</code></pre><h2>Various Data Structures to implement indexes</h2><p>There are various data structures that can be used internally to maintain indexes, each one serving a different purpose. B-Tree, Hash, R-Tree are a few popular types. Various storage engines allow users to specify different types of data structure. It is important to understand how they work in order to use them properly.</p><h2>BTree Indexes</h2><p>It maintains a BTree of indexed values so sorting would not involve extra expense. Efficient for exact-match as well as range-based comparisons e.g., =, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;&gt;, BETWEEN etc. It can also be used for LIKE expressions if the LIKE pattern string does not start with a wildcard character.</p><h2>Hash Based Indexes</h2><p>A hash function is applied to each value in the indexed column, which is then used to perform lookup instead of using the actual value. The benefit is that the lookup using hash values is much faster than the actual value. The downside is that they are efficient for exact-match comparisons however would not work in range lookup (e.g., &lt;=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, BETWEEN etc.). It cannot be used to avoid sorting operation as the hash index does not maintain any specific ordering.</p><h2>RTree Indexes</h2><p>A tree data structure used to handle spatial data. Generally used for geographic information e.g., find a fuel pump within 5 km of a specific location.</p><h2>Full Text Indexes</h2><p>This type of index works well for regular text search. They generally use inverted indexes which store a list of words and the corresponding documents in which those words appear. LIKE would not involve full text indexes; we need to use MATCH...AGAINST in MySQL (CONTAINS in MS SQL) in order to use full text index. So if we have LIKE with pattern starting wildcard e.g., '%xyz', it cannot be served by any type of index and can be extremely slow.</p><h2>Clustered and Non-Clustered Indexes</h2><p>Clustered index determines the order in which the records are stored physically in a table, so we can have only single clustered index per table. MySQL InnoDB uses primary key for making clustered index. It provides very fast lookup and retrieval of data does not require additional lookups as both the index and data resides at the same place. Clustered indexes can be costly for the columns which require frequent changes as this would involve relocating the row to new physical location.</p><p>Any other indexes are called non-clustered or secondary indexes. There can be multiple secondary indexes in a table. Each MySQL secondary index is a covering index (more on this in later section) which also contains the clustering index key for fast retrieval of data. So, we should avoid using primary key or clustering index of size much larger than requirement as that would unnecessarily waste space in secondary indexes too. Secondary indexes require separate lookup for fetching the row as data is not stored in leaf node.</p> <h2>Composite Indexes</h2><p>Composite indexes are the indexes on multiple columns. These can be helpful in certain circumstances e.g., multiple conditions in WHERE clause with AND, WHERE and ORDER BY combination on different fields.</p><p><span class='boldText'>Example:</span> An index on (CountryCode, District, Name) can be used in any of the below scenario's:</p> <pre><code>SELECT * FROM city WHERE CountryCode = 'IND' AND District='Haryana' AND Name = 'Rohtak';\nSELECT * FROM city WHERE CountryCode = 'IND' AND District = 'Haryana'\nSELECT * FROM city WHERE CountryCode = 'IND'</code> </pre> <p>We can remove the later AND conditions as long as we follow the order mentioned in the index; however, this index would not be of any help in below queries:</p> <pre><code>WHERE District = 'Haryana' AND Name = 'Bhiwani' -- no Country specified\nWHERE District = 'Haryana' -- no Country specified\nWHERE District = 'Haryana' OR Name = 'Noida' -- OR used instead of AND</code></pre><p><span class='boldText'>Example:</span> Similarly, an index on (District, Name) can be useful for this WHERE-ORDER BY combination:</p><pre>WHERE District = 'Haryana' ORDER BY Name</pre><h2>Covering Indexes</h2><p>Covering indexes are used to reduce the disk reads by including other columns used in query as well (even if not used in WHERE/GROUP By/ORDER BY). The whole query can then be served using the index itself without doing any extra read from table for additional fields. This would improve the performance greatly; however too many covering indexes have an overhead in terms of disk space and insert/update/delete operations. So, covering indexes can be used for very slow or frequently used queries. By default, MySQL InnoDB uses covering index for all the secondary keys by also including primary key in the leaf node.</p><p><span class='boldText'>Example:</span> Observe how the below query benefits significantly by using the covering index.</p><pre><code>SELECT CountryCode, SUM(Population) FROM City GROUP BY CountryCode;\nALTER TABLE City ADD INDEX indexCntry (CountryCode); -- normal index on CountryCode, reduces query execution time\nALTER TABLE City ADD INDEX indexCntryPop (CountryCode, Population); -- covering index, reduces query execution time significantly</code></pre><p>If multiple indexes are present for some query, MySQL Query Optimizer chooses the one which would perform best in this scenario e.g., in above query if both indexCntry and indexCntryPop are available, MySQL uses indexCntryPop however once we drop indexCntryPop, it would use indexCntry.</p><h2>\"EXPLAIN\" to understand index usage</h2><p>We can use EXPLAIN to understand the role of index used in performance of a query. It displays the indexes available for a query and what has been selected to execute it. For example,</p><pre><code>EXPLAIN SELECT Name, Population FROM City ORDER BY Name</code></pre><p>Below are the results before and after creating the following index:</p><pre>ALTER TABLE City ADD INDEX indexNamePop (Name, Population);</pre> <table cellpadding='0'cellspacing='0'class='newgenTable'> <tbody> <tr> <th>Result Column</th><th>Content (Without Index</th><th>Content( With Index</th> </tr><tr> <td>id</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>select_type</td><td>SIMPLE</td><td>SIMPLE</td></tr><tr><td>table</td><td>City</td></tr><tr><td>type</td><td>ALL</td><td>index</td></tr><tr><td>possible_keys</td><td>&lt;null&gt;</td><td>&lt;null&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>key</td><td>&lt;null&gt;</td><td>indexNamePop</td></tr> <tr><td>key_len</td><td>&lt;null&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>ref</td><td>&lt;null&gt;</td><td>&lt;null&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>rows</td><td>4321</td><td>4321</td></tr><tr><td>extra</td><td>Using filesort</td><td>Using index</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Without the index, filesort is performed to perform the ordering however, as soon as the index is created the \"filesort\" is no longer required (result is directly served using index indexNamePop) so the query would execute faster.</p><h2>What to Index</h2><p>Indexes are particularly useful in the databases where read/select operation is performed more frequently than write.</p><p>Deciding on columns to index is not evident by looking at the database schema alone. It actually depends on how your application uses that database. The queries which are slow OR the one's which are frequently running on a larger data-set are good candidates to consider for indexing. You can identify them using your application's log or MySQL slow query log.</p><p>The columns to be indexed should have high cardinality. Cardinality of a column refers to the number of unique values in that column. A primary key or any other UNIQUE key has cardinality which equals number of rows in the table. Some columns like Gender, Color, Status etc. would have low cardinality. Creating indexes on low cardinality columns can adversely impact the performance of the query rather than improving it. An index is useful in the cases where you have to select/search a small set of data from a large number of values. However in case of low cardinality e.g., gender = 'Male', even if you are using index you end up fetching around half of the records (assuming 1:1 male female ratio) which is same as liner search. Moreover the index would require storage and update overhead without serving much purpose in improving the performance.</p><p>Size of the column to be indexed is also important as small size would mean less space to store the index and less searching time. So, if VARCHAR(50) is sufficient for the Name field, do not use VARCHAR(80). Apart from this, as already discussed, MySQL secondary indexes also maintain primary key in the node along with index key so the primary key should also be kept small wherever possible.</p> <p>Look at the WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY and GROUP BY clause of the query.</p><p>The columns in WHERE clause can be used for creating index. Salary can be indexed for below WHERE clause.</p> <p><code> WHERE salary &gt; 10000</code></p><p>If there are multiple columns in WHERE clause with AND connector, then we can use composite index too.</p><p><code>WHERE country='India'AND state ='Haryana'AND city = 'Bhiwani'</code></p> <p>Here we can make a composite index on country, state and city. However, if we have OR in WHERE clause then we cannot use composite indexes.</p><p>When there is a JOIN between two or more tables then the JOIN column used for lookup in the JOINED tables can be indexed e.g.,</p><pre><code>SELECT * FROM Country c\nLEFT OUTER JOIN City ct\nON ct.countryCode=c.Code</code></pre><p>An index on CountryCode column of table City would help in this.</p><p>If WHERE and ORDER BY are on different fields then we can use composite index by putting where column first and then order by column e.g.,</p><p><code>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM City WHERE CountryCode = 'XYZ' ORDER BY name</code></p><p>You can observe that \"Using filesort\" is removed from column Extra of result when you create an index on (CountryCode, Name).</p><p>Similarly, if there is WHERE and GROUP BY in a query then an index on (WHERE column, GROUP BY column) would help. e.g.,</p><pre><code>EXPLAIN SELECT Continent, count(Code) FROM country WHERE Population &gt; 1000 GROUP BY Continent\nALTER TABLE country ADD INDEX cp (Continent, Population)</code></pre><table cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' class='newgenTable'><tbody><tr><th>Result Column</th><th>Content (Without Index)</th><th>Content (With Index</th></tr><tr><td>id</td><td>1</td> <td>1</td></tr><tr><td>select_type</td><td> SIMPLE</td> <td>SIMPLE</td></tr><tr> <td>table</td><td>country</td><td>country</td></tr><tr> <td>type</td><td>ALL</td><td>index</td></tr><tr><td>possible_keys</td><td>&lt;null&gt;</td><td>&lt;null&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>key</td><td>&lt;null&gt;</td><td>cp</td></tr><tr><td>key_len</td><td>&lt;null&gt;</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>ref</td><td>&lt;null&gt;</td><td>&lt;null&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>rows</td> <td>241</td><td>241</td></tr><tr><td>extra</td><td>Using where Using temporary Using filesort</td> <td>Using where Using index</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As I already discussed that usefulness of indexes depend upon how we query the database; it is essential to perform an analysis from time to time to add appropriate indexes or remove unused as and when the application code changes, table size increases or some queries are invoked more frequently.</p><p>Now next time you encounter an extremely slow query dealing with a large data set and have already tried different ways to rewrite it to make it fast; try indexing on appropriate columns.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Every person, working with database, developer or DBA has to come across with issues related to database performance. One morning I reached office and my boss said that they are experiencing slowness in the production system and wanted my team to fix it before it crashes. I and my co-developer sat together, looked at few things, applied some techniques and finally optimized the database performance. Though, it would not be possible to list out all approaches but I would like to walk you through what I did to optimize database performance.</p><h2>Missing indexes</h2><p>Indexes do not matter when your database is small. In that case, SQL server does full table scan and reads data. But when your database becomes large, these scans kill the database performance. We analyzed the queries used in our code, looked at the columns in the JOIN, WHERE and ORDER BY CLAUSE. We then checked and found indexes on those columns were missing. We analyzed and created Non-Clustered indexes on them and it helped us achieve performance gains. Following is a snapshot of a query that had Clustered Index specified but still it is not giving us much performance gains because of Scan operation. After creating Non-Clustered indexes on appropriate columns, 50% gain is achieved. Though I cannot post the actual query, still I have tried to create a similar query to explain this scenario.</p><p></p><p><img src='../images/db_opt_1.jpg' alt='Database before Non-Clustered Index'></p><p><span >Figure 1: Before Non-Clustered Index</span></p><p></p><p><img src='../images/db_opt_2.jpg' alt='Database after Non-Clustered Index'></p><p><span> Figure 2: After Non-Clustered Index</span></p><h2>Use Covering Indexes</h2><p>Once, it happened that there was a simple query that worked fine in development but when put in production, it was taking longer time. Usually, development environment does not have as much data as in production. Look at the query in below snapshot. It's a simple query but does lookup even though index is created on the column. The reason is, it does Bookmark Lookups (in the absence of Clustered index on the table) or RID Lookup (In the presence of Clustered Index on the table). The reason is that to retrieve other column data (columns in the select list), SQL server does scan operation along with index seek. This is the reason behind Bookmark or RID Lookup which is an exhaustive process. <a href='http://www.newgeninfinite.com/insights/blog/how-to-effectivley-use-database-indexes' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()'>Creating covering indexes</a> eliminates these Lookups. Again, I created a sample query to demonstrate this scenario.</p><p></p><p><img src='../images/db_opt_3.jpg' alt='Without Covering Index'></p><p><span>Figure 3: Without Covering Index (performs Lookup)</span></p><p></p><p><img src='../images/db_opt_4.jpg' alt='Covering Index'></p><p><span>Figure 4: Covering Index</span></p><p></p><p><img src='../images/db_opt_5.jpg' alt='With Covering Index'></p><p><span>Figure 5: With Covering Index</span></p><h2>Avoid the use of * in SELECT statement</h2><p>It is always advisable not to use SELECT *. Instead use SELECT Col1, Col2, Col3. I happened to be victim of SELECT * which totally changed the way I used to write queries. Let's see what are the consequences of SELECT * over SELECT Column_List.</p><ul class='list'><li>Query parsing is slow with 'SELECT *'. When a query is written as <span style='color: #008080;'>SELECT*FROMTABLE1,</span> database engine first hits system tables to get the list of columns associated with TABLE1. This process takes some time and for heavy database and busy environment, this time is a pain. Instead, write queries like <span style='color: #008080;'>SELECT COL1, COL2, COL3 FROM TABLE1 </span>. This technique saves us the overhead of querying system tables to get column list for the associated table.</li><li>With 'Select *', when table schema grows i.e. more columns are added, we unintentionally force SQL server to return those columns as well even if they are not required. This is not a good practice. This approach unnecessarily causes network jam. By explicitly specifying column list, we return only what is required and hence less network traffic.</li></ul><h2>SET NOCOUNT ON</h2><p>I was unaware of the issues that NOCOUNT OFF can cause until I myself ran into it. I was once working on a large transactional database. I wrote one stored procedure that did a complex task. It was doing many SELECTS, few INSERTS and UPDATES. After completing the stored procedure, I gave it to my DBA. Our DBA reverted back to me for adding SET NOCOUNT ON at the start of stored procedures body. I was quite surprised and in my curiosity I asked WHY? Then he explained to me that 'When NOCOUNT is OFF, an additional information, number of rows affected, is returned back to the client application. This information is sent over a network and when you are using a large number of SQL statements, it is a considerable performance hit. Mostly, this information is irrelevant. So, it is considered a good practice to set it to ON to restrict this information from being sent to the calling application thereby freeing up the network bandwidth'.</p><p></p><p><img src='../images/db_opt_6.jpg' alt='Database when NOCOUNT is OFF'></p><p><span>Figure 6: When NOCOUNT is OFF</span></p><p></p><p><img src='../images/db_opt_7.jpg' alt='Database when NOCOUNT is ON'></p><p>Figure 7: When NOCOUNT is ON</p><h2>Keep Transactions short</h2><p>I remember I was once approached by my friend over the stored procedure that once run causes slowness in the system. Until that code finishes, few other stored procedures were behaving slow. Upon further investigation, we found that it was actually explicit transaction which was causing system slowness. We investigated that transaction was started well before they were required to be. There were many complex validations that were carried out under the transaction and the interesting thing was that there was no need to transaction for those validations. Though, explicit transactions are a good way to make sure that database is in consistent state. Means, it helps us to make sure that either data is fully written to the database or rolled back completely. For batch operations, explicit transactions play a vital role. But like every coin has two faces, transactions also have a drawback when used without proper attention. Drawback is that once started, they lock the system objects till they either COMMIT or ROLLBACK. Until a transaction is complete, other transactions are forced to wait (which need access to same objects). The result is slowness in the system. Longer the transactions takes to complete, more is the slowness encountered in the system. We moved validations out of transaction. Other stored procedures were executed before this stored procedure reaches the transaction and it provided performance benefit. So, try to keep transactions as short as possible so that database objects are available to other transactions as soon as possible.</p>",

As a software provider company you cannot move away from this fact, rather embracing this change quickly is a key to success in current market.</p><p>How do you manage all your server side code in an enterprise level business application? The answer is simple: you break it into its individual modules which can be developed and tested independent of one another and then you put all pieces back together to get back to the bigger picture. A lot of design patterns and frameworks are available for managing your server side code to support this concept. But wait a second, what about the front end. When it comes to the front end, we do not always pay much attention to the modular development and starts putting the things together without concerning about the design and many a times; the result is horrible code spaghettis whose maintenance becomes a nightmare. It may work for small scale applications but not for large scale enterprise application which might have 100000 LOC of Javascript.</p><p>Currently there are so many UI Frameworks are available in market. Some of them are paid and some are totally free (open source). Surprisingly, the free ones are more feature rich and provide more flexibility in terms of implementation and maintenance. Here we are going to talk about our experience with three such widely used frameworks: Angular.js, Knockout.js and Backbone.js.</p><p><a href='http://www.newgeninfinite.com/insights/case-studies/crafting-design-studio' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()'>We developed a full-fledged Crafting design studio using Angular.</a> This studio was the part of product package and it consists of multiple logical modules for different functionalities. Further there was huge scope of enhancement and maintenance activities around the whole eco system. Considering these facts we found Angular to be best choice of available options.</p><p>Most of the frameworks force you to split your application into MVC modules defined by framework itself and then you have to write code to put everything together. This is where Angular takes lead on others. With Angular you have to split your application code into MVC modules but you need not to write any code to bind them up again. This is automatically taken care by Angular. It reduces a lot of code and possible bugs.</p><p>Two way data binding proved to be pretty handy in our case as it again saved a lot of coding effort of developers. The application design consists of a lot of popups which we easily implemented using bootstrap which is inbuilt in Angular. We extensively used Angular directives which increased code reusability. In our case it was crucial to write maintainable code and ensure that any new maintenance change doesn't break any existing functionality. Angular's emphasis on 'separation of concern' automatically takes care of this problem. On top of this we used Karma framework to write automated unit test cases. It helped us ensuring code quality all the time.</p><p>It gives a little insight that the entities in the application have a complex structure and complex DOM interactions and from the harder surface, it might be concluded that to support this functionality, Backbone.js is a better candidate than Knockout and Angular.</p><p>The philosophy of Backbone.js is very simple and it doesn't enforce you to do things in its own way. It doesn't provide any high level functionality either but it lays down the foundation, a solid foundation, on which large scale applications can be developed. But there is one downside of Backbone and that is the boilerplate code that may clutter the actual functionality implementation. Backbone provides Models, Views, Routes but it doesn't provide Controllers, Composite views, Layouts, Modules etc. That is where, Marionette.js comes in handy. Marionette is another JS library based on Backbone to keep you off the hook from boilerplate code and focus on the actual implementation. It hides house-keeping tasks within itself and provides various application level objects to better organize your code, to keep the concerns separate and hence let you write code which requires low maintenance.</p><p>Backbone + Marionette combo proved to be a solid base for our application. Backbone comes with underscore.js, a low level utility library. We decided to move to lodash.js, a fork of underscore.js, just because of the performance and compatibility gain provided by lodash over underscore. We also decided to move to Handlerbar templates instead of using the default underscore/lodash templates to enforce logic-less templating.</p><p>In another critical project we developed a resource management application using Knockout.js. Knockout is a standalone JavaScript library which is based on MVVM architecture unlike Angular and Backbone. It provides quite a flexible structure which allows developers to use a number of supporting JavaScript libraries.</p><p>This was a Single page application containing a number of views and each view shows good amount of data which can be edited at run time. Knockout proved to be very handy in this case as it provides two way data binding out of the box. It saved a lot of developer effort.</p><p>Along with Knockout we used a number of different JavaScript libraries for different purposes. For communication between flash components and HTML components we developed a separate module using Amplify.js. For automatic routing of views and browser handling we used Sammy.js. Bootstrap was used extensively for popups, pallets and other controls. Require.js was used for module loading while execution in browser. Bunch of other Javascript libraries like Bunddle.js etc. were also used for different purposes.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Java technology has been evolving since its initial release in 1995. Apart from the OOPS concepts, language basics/syntax and various business layer frameworks which keep coming with time, there are a number of things which every Java developer should understand and use, from development to deployment, in order to do collaborative software development in an efficient way. I have summarized some of these tools/techniques/practices. Though the items below do not specifically apply to Java, however they have been discussed here in context of Java (with an exception of version control systems and issue tracking tools, which apply to any kind of software development).</p><h2>Version Control Systems(VCS)</h2><p>Version Control Systems help various developers work independently yet collaboratively on a single project, without impacting each other's changes. It helps maintain a history of all the changes. Any unwanted changes, if accidently done to the code can be rolled back to some stable version in the past. There are two types of version control systems:</p><p><strong>Centralized (CVCS)</strong>: A single copy of repository is maintained on server. Developers get the latest code from repository, make their changes and commit the changes to central repository. Developers only need to keep a single copy of the project on their local machines. Any version or version history can be fetched from central repository as and when required. Some popular centralized version control systems are: CVS (open source, one of the oldest and still being used), SVN (open source, one of the most widely used), Perforce (commercial) etc.</p><p><strong>Distributed (DVCS)</strong>: This works as peer-to-peer model. Developers have a copy of repository and complete version history on their local systems. Developers commit their changes locally without requiring network connections. Thus, all the operations except for pull and push to remote repository are extremely fast. Pushing a group of commits makes them available to other developers via pull. There are performance gains as well as it makes the system more fault tolerant as every copy of project on developer's systems itself is a complete repository.</p><p>Some popular open source DVCS used currently are: Git (many organizations switching from SVN to Git), Mercural, Bazaar etc.</p><h2>Code Analysis and Quality Tools</h2><p>There are tools <a href='http://www.newgeninfinite.com/insights/blog/importance-of-code-reviews' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()'>available which can analyze code statically to detect possible issues</a> and suggest improvements. Most of these can be integrated with popular IDEs e.g., in Eclipse via plugins, so that developers can benefit during development phase itself. Quality control rules are configurable mostly.</p><p>SonarQube, one of the most widely used, is an open source platform for managing code quality. It's functionality can be extended by using plugins for other analysis tools e.g., PMD, FindBugs, Checkstyle etc. Hence, it allows to perform multiple tool analaysis at a single place. The dashboard presents the results of various plugins.</p><p class='boldText'>Some of the popular tools are:</p><ul class='list'><li>Ecl Emma, Cobertura - for ensuring code coverage.</li><li>Checkstyle - ensures adherence to coding standards.</li><li>FindBugs - reports issues in the code, operates on bytecode and is thus able to detect various bugs in the code.</li><li>PMD - code analyzer for finding common programming flaws.</li></ul><h2>Debugging and Profiling Tools</h2><p>Being familiar with the debugging techniques can save you great effort in the times of crisis. Its essential for the developers to be aware of breakpoints, watch, inspection, step-through execution etc. Its a great tool to figure out cause of various programming bugs/flaw.</p><p>Almost all IDEs today provide convenient interactive ways to debug (no need to print, trace, assert).</p><p>Remote debuging allows to debug applications running on different JVM or machines.</p><p>Profiling lets you measure application's performance in terms of cpu usage, memory usage etc. and helps track down bottlenecks. JDK itself provides VisualVM for free for lightweight profiling and monitoring needs. Starting JDK 7 Update 40, Oracle's Java Mission Control tool is also bundled with the HotSpot JVM.</p><p>There are commercial profiling tools available for advanced profiling needs e.g., YourKit, JProfiler, Oracle's Java Mission Control, jClarity (Illuminate and Censum). They generally integrate nicely with your favorite IDEs or offer easy to use GUI; have several profiling options like memory, cpu, database call profiling etc. You can profile your application deployed locally, remotely or even at production.</p><h2>Unit Testing Frameworks and Tools</h2><p>Though generally neglected due to tight schedules, testing ahead of time can help you save on effort and time and help build quality product with minimal bugs.</p><p>There are automated test case frameworks available which can greatly reduce manual testing effort. Once written, test cases can be run with almost zero effort. This helps in regression too; help identify any bugs introduced by some other bug fixes. JUnit, TestNG are two popular frameworks for unit testing java code.</p><p>While performing unit testing, its not uncommon to come across the scenario where the code under test has external dependencies (for example, a webservice or dao call). Mocking external dependencies allows us to focus on the code under test instead of dealing with the behavior of external dependencies in test scenario's. Mocking frameworks allow us to mock external dependencies by setting expectations about their behavior when they are invoked.</p><p>There are various mocking frameworks available for java, which work in conjunction with unit testing frameworks e.g., Mockito, EasyMock, PowerMock etc.</p><p>PowerMock is a powerful framework which extends other mocking frameworks (currently Mockito and EasyMock) to enable some features which are not yet available with those frameworks e.g., mocking static methods, constructors, final classes, final methods, private methods, removal of static initializers etc.</p><p>Investing on learning any of these unit testing and mocking frameworks would certainly pay off in long run.</p><h2>Design Patterns</h2><p>Design patterns are time-tested well-described solutions to commonly occurring design problems in software development. Someone have already solved a problem in an efficient way and you can use this wisdom to solve a similar problem of yours. Design patterns do not provide you with any re-usable code/implementation/component but it facilitates you a reusable design for your problem's solution in a well-tested and optimized way.</p><p class='boldText'>There are three categories of design patterns:</p><p>Creational Patterns: deals with design problems related to object creation e.g., Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Prototype, Builder etc.</p><p><strong>Structural Patterns</strong>: deals with composition of classes/objects to form larger structures to solve a particular problem e.g., Proxy, Adapter, Composite, Facade, Bridge, Decorator, Flyweight etc.</p><p><strong>Behavioral Patterns</strong>: deals with inter-object communication e.g., Template Method, Chain of Responsibility, Observer, Strategy, Command, Visitor, Iterator etc.</p><p>Understanding various design patterns and their usage help identify the patterns which can be used in solving the problem at hand. The benefits are - an efficient solution with reduced learning curve, increased code maintainability and well-thought-of pros/cons to understand in a particular problem scenario.</p><p>Apart from that, there are various design patterns used in JDK implementation, understanding them helps understand their proper usage and how things work e.g., decorator pattern is used heavily in java.io classes, chain of responsibility in java.util.logging.Logger, javax.servlet.Filter etc.</p><h2>Build Management Tools</h2><p>For most but the very simple projects where build is just a single command process, it would be helful to use a build tool to automate build process.</p><p>Build tools manage and organize your builds - they handle all build tasks like build, versioning, packging, dependency management (for multi-project builds), running tests to validate build, deploy etc.</p><p>Build tools can be run within IDEs or independently. They can also be used by Continuous Integration tools (more on Continuous Integration later in this article).</p><p>Three popular build tools in java world are: Apache Ant (uses Ivy for dependency management), Apache Maven and Graddle.</p><p>Ant was one of the first modern build tools (released in 2000) and is still being used even after popularity of Maven (released in 2002). Gradle, released lately - in 2012, also seems promising and getting good response. Ant uses XML to describe the build process, which can easily become overly verbose for large/complex projects. Maven uses XML too, but the approach is declarative and based on default configurations and available targets/goals which can be invoked. Gradle instead uses Groovy based DSL, with shorter and clearer scripts; but involves initial learning curve. All three can be easily extended to provide additional functionality.</p><h2>Issue Tracking Tools</h2><p>Issue tracking tools are used to keep track of bugs/incidents reported as well as the complete workflow for issues e.g., reporting, assigning for estimation/development, fixing, qa verification etc. Some of the open source tools are - BugZilla, Mantis etc. and Commerical are - JetBrains YouTrack, Atlassian JIRA etc.</p><h2>Continuous Integration and Delivery Tools</h2><p>Continuous Integration is the development practice wherein developers frequently checks-in code to mainstream repository; which is then build automatically (generally after every check-in) to ensure that code compiles and is validated against a number of automated tests. This can detect any integration issues early, hence minimizing the time to fix.</p><p>Jenkins, an open source CI tool, has gained popularity in last few years. It integrates with a number of other tools via plugins like SonarQube, CheckStyle, Cobertura, FindBugs, JIRA, PMD etc. Some Other popular CI tools are:</p><ul class='list'><li>Open source - Hudson (later forked to Jenkins), CruiseControl etc.</li><li>Commercial tools - Atlassian Bamboo, ThoughtWorks Go, Jetbrains Team City etc.</li></ul><p>Continuous Delivery takes a step ahead of Continuous Integration. It is a practice exercised to ensure that the software is always production ready and can be deployed as and when required. It helps deliver software early with latest features, incrementally releasing the features; hence shortens the time to market.</p><p>Continuous Delivery requires continuous integration (code quality analysis, some of the test cases execution can be done at this stage), test automation (additional integration, acceptance, stress/load, performance, smoke testing and manual testing etc.) on some test/staging environments, configuration automation and then finally one step deployment to production environment. They also should have easy rollback mechanism so that in case any bug go undetected (despite all the testing), then it can be rolled back to previous stable release. There are specific deployment automation tools in market to help facilitate the Continuous Delivery workflow:</p><p>CA Release Automation (earlier known as Nolio Automation Centre), LiveRebel from Zeroturnaround, DeployIT from XebiaLabs.</p><h2>New Features in Java Versions</h2><p>Java platform is continually evolving; new features and capabilities are added in each version. Java 8, latest release of java, introduced functional interfaces, lambda expressions, default methods, repeating annotations among several other features. Java 9, which is expected to be released in 2016, is expected to offer source code modularity (Jigsaw project), light weight JSON API, money/currency APIs, process API updates, smart java compiler and a number of other enhancements.</p><p>Its a must for a thriving software developer to keep himself up to date about the technology.</p>",

            "content": "<p>As we all know the beauty of Entity Framework (EF) is that it automatically generates Classes for various model entities (tables, views etc.). No extra effort is needed to simulate the behavior of these entities by creating custom classes in solution (C# code) as we used to do before the introduction of EF.</p><p>Although we have all C# classes available in the solution for each of the entities in the database but still sometimes situation occurs where we need to have some additional members or properties in these auto generated classes but not at the cost of creating new columns to the tables in the database. It means having virtual properties for application scope only &amp; there is no physical existence of these properties. So we can have following approaches for the:</p><ul class='list'><li>Create new poco classes with the duplicating original properties and adding new properties</li><li>Extending the existing auto generated classes by EF</li></ul><p>Again creating new C# classes is overhead of maintaining multiple classes for a single entity. It may lead to complexity and reduces the readability of the code as well. So extending the existing auto generated classes seems to be a good alternative.</p><p>Summary of Application: Trip Management is to keep track of various trips planned in an organization for their employees. 'EmpTripAssoc' table is to keep track of employees which are associated with any trip. So both EmpId and TripId are foreign keys here. Employee &amp; Trip are lookup tables for employee's data and trips planned in the system. Below is the Entity Framework structure:</p><p><img alt='Trip Management Entity Framework structure' src='../images/blog3_img-1.jpg' class='centerdImages'></p><p>In this example an administrator would need to have an interface (TripPlan.aspx) where he can select multiple Employees from a list to associate them with a Trip. Let us say on the interface there one dropdown for Trip selection and grid below it for multiple employee selection &amp; then a 'Save' button to save the association in 'EmpTripAssoc' table. Similarly on the same interface, grid would display employees in selected mode which are already planned for selected trip.</p><p>Find below the code written for Trip Plan page.</p><strong>TripPlan.aspx</strong><pre><code>&lt;%@ Page <span style='color:#ff0000;'>Language</span>='C#' <span style='color:#ff0000;'>AutoEventWireup</span>='true'<span style='color:#ff0000;'>CodeBehind</span>='TripPlan.aspx.cs' Inherits='Use_of_Partial_Class.TripPlan' %&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE <span style='color:#ff0000;'>html</span>&gt;\n&lt;html <span style='color:#ff0000;'>xmlns</span>='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'&gt;\n&lt;head <span style='color:#ff0000;'>runat</span>='server'&gt;\n   &lt;title&gt;

Developer's and reviewer's job became easy when Microsoft introduced automatic tools for code analysis. These utilities cover all aspects of code analysis &amp; review.</p><p>We feel that logical code review can only be done by people who know requirements very well of the proposed system in development. Currently reviewers just need to focus on logical review with respect to requirements of the application. As other aspects of code review and analysis can be done with the help of 'Code Analysis' feature of Visual Studio.</p><p>The feature is available in Visual Studio 2012 or above, VS 2010 Premium and VS 2010 Ultimate editions.</p><p>The Visual Studio Code Analysis feature helps developers to find out performance, security, designing, exception management, globalization &amp; other problems to improve the Code Quality. Code Analysis can be performed on a complete solution or a specific project in the solution.</p><p>To perform Code Analysis, open your solution in VS 2012, expand ANALYZE tab on the menu bar &amp; select Run Code Analysis on Solution as shown below.<br><br><img alt='Visual Studio menu bar Analyze Tab' src='../images/blog_1.jpg' class='centerdImages'></p><p>We would see a new 'Code Analysis' tab adjacent to 'Solution Explorer' tab (see below).</p><p><img alt='Code Analysis Tab' src='../images/blog_2.jpg' style='width: 350px; height: 279px;' class='centerdImages'></p><p>In this example we can see two records (Errors + Warnings) in the window with the same code (CA2214) in two separate files (Employee.cs &amp; Trip.cs). Resultant list can be further filtered by searching keywords in 'Search' text box.</p><p>In order to see the detail, just select the Message, it would expand itself &amp; also highlight the piece of code against which this warning is generated. For each message a developer can take certain actions (Copy, Create a Work Item, Suppress Message) by Right Click or by pressing the Action link.</p><p><img alt='Code Analysis Tab messages' src='../images/blog_3.jpg' class='centerdImages'></p><p>To Configure Code Analysis for a specific project or for the complete solution, <strong>Right Click</strong> on the selected project or solution, select Properties &amp; then select <strong>Code Analysis</strong>. In this window developer can set Configurations (Debug, Release, All) &amp; Platform (Any CPU, X64 etc.) settings and can also select a Rule Set or Multiple Rules Sets for the Code Analysis from default rule set list as shown below. By default 'Microsoft Managed Recommended Rules' is selected.</p><p><img alt='Code Analysis Configurations' src='../images/blog_4.jpg' class='centerdImages'></p><p>To select multiple rule sets click on optionÂ&nbsp; <strong>&lt;Choose multiple rule sets..&gt;</strong><choose multiple='' rule=''> and click on <strong>Save As</strong> button to give this set a specific name and the same rule set would be visible in the dropdown above.</choose></p><p><img alt='Code Analysis Configuration Multiple Rule Sets Selection' src='../images/blog_5.jpg' style='width: 500px; height: 288px;' class='centerdImages'></p><p>Similarly further configurations can be done by selecting only specific categories and Ids within a rule set and saving it as new rule set. Moreover rules severity can be set to 'Error', 'Warning', 'None' or 'Inherit' by changing its action. Press 'Open' button next to Rule Set drop down control to configure rules.</p><p><img alt='Code Analysis Configuration Categories' src='../images/blog_6.jpg' style='width: 600px; height: 240px;' class='centerdImages'></p><p>Code Analysis can not only be done manually using 'Run Code Analysis', it can be run automatically on each build. To run the code analysis automatically while building the source code, check the 'Enable Code Analysis on Build' option on the code analysis window (Figure - Code Analysis Settings).</p><p>The useful features of <a href='http://www.newgeninfinite.com/insights/blog/importance-of-code-reviews' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()'>'Code Analysis' have become very useful for developers.</a><br>For complete details of every code analysis warning please visit<a href='http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee1hzekz(v=vs.100).aspx' target='blank' rel='nofollow'>http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee1hzekz(v=vs.100).aspx</a></p>",

            "content": "<p>It was my first day at office. It happens rarely but I was nervous so I reached office before time. Around 9 am, people started coming to office. After 15 minutes, they all gathered in near hall and started discussing on some issue. I thought that they didn't have meeting-rooms here.</p><p>After brief discussion all started working at their respective seats.</p><p>Project Manager came to me and discussed about the various aspects of the project on which I was supposed to work there. He explained to me that 'SCRUM Methodology' is followed there and invited me to next day's 'Daily Scrum Meeting'. I agreed with him on every issue to show I knew and understood everything. As he left me, I jumped onto my system and tried to understand everything about SCRUM?</p><p>I found that it's a type of agile methodology. After reading about it on Wikipedia, I felt confident that I could handle SCRUM method. For rest of the day, I attended a training session and set up my work environment.</p><p>Next day, I hurried to office to be on time as I was getting back to my normal routine. First thing on my mind was to get prepared for Daily Scrum feature. I was thinking that I need to install this feature in my memory.</p><h2>First Daily Scrum Meeting</h2><p>Everyone was standing in a circle and I also made my place by getting into the circle. Person standing in front of me started explaining some of the points like:</p><ul class='list'><li>What he had done yesterday?</li><li>What he was going to do thatday? And</li><li>Was there any impediment?</li></ul><p>Then, he went to the white board and updated one of the multiple sticky notes. I looked at the board and what I could remember was:</p><table border='0'' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' class='newgenTable' width='100%'><tbody><tr><th>User Story</th><th>To Do</th><th>In Progress</th><th>To Verify</th><th>Done</th></tr><tr><td>Story 1</td><td>Task C</td><td>Task B</td><td>Â&nbsp;</td><td>Task A</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>I found some keywords on the board:</h2><p>User story- It contained details just like a feature or some enhancements in a product.</p><p>Task- Task was to break user story into small tasks which could be measured in 1-8 hours.</p><p>All these things were making a round in my mind; suddenly my chance came and then I had to share what I had done a day before. The moment I started, I fumbled and somehow I could manage to explain whatever I had understood during my preparation.</p><p>After every one had finished, SCRUM Master asked me to add few more points and break it down on the board. Scrum Master was the person who was supposed to manage all the scrum related issues. Before finishing I shared with them that there were lots of activities that we could perform other than coding in our SCRUM methodology.</p><p>After few days of daily scrum meetings, I got to know another term called 'Sprint'. Actually I was already the part of current sprint that came to me as shock. I tell you why it came as shock during my Wikipedia research. I had found that at the end of sprint we needed to show demo to the team and Product owner.</p><p>Next question hammering my mind was when this sprint was going to end, so I asked to my fellow members who said that they do 15 days sprint? After hearing it, I got relaxed that I had one more week time.</p><p>One of my favorite parts of the Scrum was Story Pointing Session. I could handle this session anytime when product owner and Scrum Master wanted. In this all team members gathered to play with Poker Cards (Cards with Fibonacci Sequence Printed on it). Yes, you heard it right but we were going to take benefits of poker cards technically. Scrum Master told everyone about a story, everyone needed to understand and evaluate the story to find out in how much time they could complete and then raise the poker card accordingly.</p><p>When Scrum Master finished his user story, every one of us raised our cards. I tried to do my best to analyze the story. I did not know that odd person in the group had to speak and prove why it would take less or more time. I was caught in that trap. I spoke in the favor of less time whereas everyone else advocated for more time. They asked me how story A can be finished in this time duration. I tried my best to explain but I was unable to convince because I did not consider branching and propagation part of the user story. A lesson was learned that day that always ask for more time than what you estimate.</p><p>After few days of hard work, judgment day came. I was ready to showcase the story that I had worked upon in the sprint. Everyone was called for the Sprint Review meeting. Basically this meeting was called for finalizing which team had completed the task during the spring and can be showcased to the Stakeholders and Product owner.</p><p>After the meeting, everyone gathered to the Demo Session. My turn came; I did not fumble that time. In fact it went well and as I was about to go into weekend party mode our SCRUM Master had announced about two things which was new for me:</p><ul class='list'><li>Burn down Chart</li><li>Sprint Retrospective Meeting.</li></ul><p>Burn down Chart is really a way to burn you down. This chart highlighted how we had progressed through complete sprint. I found every time I looked into it our progress was going down and down so I stopped looking into it.</p><p>According to me 'Retrospective Meeting' was another grilling session in which we were forced to reflect on our last sprint. Team answered few questions like:</p><ul class='list'><li>What went well during the sprint?</li><li>What went bad?</li><li>Where could we improve?</li></ul><p>Next sprint Cycle came and I was about to declare that I knew everything about this Scrum, there came a twist.</p><p>Sprint Planning was the missing part of the puzzle. Again, another meeting session came in which we looked into huge amount of work called Product backlog and prioritize the items and then stories were allocated to the user.</p><p>As you can see basically Scrum means: a never ending cycle of meetings and work.</p><p>To summarize, one cannot learn SCRUM until one dives into it. Every day meetings, fortnightly deliveries takes a toll on all individuals but despite this one needs to wrap it up.</p>",
