        "content": "<p>It was my first day at office. It happens rarely but I was nervous so I reached office before time. Around 9 am, people started coming to office. After 15 minutes, they all gathered in near hall and started discussing on some issue. I thought that they didn't have meeting-rooms here.</p><p>After brief discussion all started working at their respective seats.</p><p>Project Manager came to me and discussed about the various aspects of the project on which I was supposed to work there. He explained to me that 'SCRUM Methodology' is followed there and invited me to next day's 'Daily Scrum Meeting'. I agreed with him on every issue to show I knew and understood everything. As he left me, I jumped onto my system and tried to understand everything about SCRUM?</p><p>I found that it's a type of agile methodology. After reading about it on Wikipedia, I felt confident that I could handle SCRUM method. For rest of the day, I attended a training session and set up my work environment.</p><p>Next day, I hurried to office to be on time as I was getting back to my normal routine. First thing on my mind was to get prepared for Daily Scrum feature. I was thinking that I need to install this feature in my memory.</p><h2>First Daily Scrum Meeting</h2><p>Everyone was standing in a circle and I also made my place by getting into the circle. Person standing in front of me started explaining some of the points like:</p><ul class='list'><li>What he had done yesterday?</li><li>What he was going to do thatday? And</li><li>Was there any impediment?</li></ul><p>Then, he went to the white board and updated one of the multiple sticky notes. I looked at the board and what I could remember was:</p><table border='0'' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' class='newgenTable' width='100%'><tbody><tr><th>User Story</th><th>To Do</th><th>In Progress</th><th>To Verify</th><th>Done</th></tr><tr><td>Story 1</td><td>Task C</td><td>Task B</td><td>Â&nbsp;</td><td>Task A</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>I found some keywords on the board:</h2><p>User story- It contained details just like a feature or some enhancements in a product.</p><p>Task- Task was to break user story into small tasks which could be measured in 1-8 hours.</p><p>All these things were making a round in my mind; suddenly my chance came and then I had to share what I had done a day before. The moment I started, I fumbled and somehow I could manage to explain whatever I had understood during my preparation.</p><p>After every one had finished, SCRUM Master asked me to add few more points and break it down on the board. Scrum Master was the person who was supposed to manage all the scrum related issues. Before finishing I shared with them that there were lots of activities that we could perform other than coding in our SCRUM methodology.</p><p>After few days of daily scrum meetings, I got to know another term called 'Sprint'. Actually I was already the part of current sprint that came to me as shock. I tell you why it came as shock during my Wikipedia research. I had found that at the end of sprint we needed to show demo to the team and Product owner.</p><p>Next question hammering my mind was when this sprint was going to end, so I asked to my fellow members who said that they do 15 days sprint? After hearing it, I got relaxed that I had one more week time.</p><p>One of my favorite parts of the Scrum was Story Pointing Session. I could handle this session anytime when product owner and Scrum Master wanted. In this all team members gathered to play with Poker Cards (Cards with Fibonacci Sequence Printed on it). Yes, you heard it right but we were going to take benefits of poker cards technically. Scrum Master told everyone about a story, everyone needed to understand and evaluate the story to find out in how much time they could complete and then raise the poker card accordingly.</p><p>When Scrum Master finished his user story, every one of us raised our cards. I tried to do my best to analyze the story. I did not know that odd person in the group had to speak and prove why it would take less or more time. I was caught in that trap. I spoke in the favor of less time whereas everyone else advocated for more time. They asked me how story A can be finished in this time duration. I tried my best to explain but I was unable to convince because I did not consider branching and propagation part of the user story. A lesson was learned that day that always ask for more time than what you estimate.</p><p>After few days of hard work, judgment day came. I was ready to showcase the story that I had worked upon in the sprint. Everyone was called for the Sprint Review meeting. Basically this meeting was called for finalizing which team had completed the task during the spring and can be showcased to the Stakeholders and Product owner.</p><p>After the meeting, everyone gathered to the Demo Session. My turn came; I did not fumble that time. In fact it went well and as I was about to go into weekend party mode our SCRUM Master had announced about two things which was new for me:</p><ul class='list'><li>Burn down Chart</li><li>Sprint Retrospective Meeting.</li></ul><p>Burn down Chart is really a way to burn you down. This chart highlighted how we had progressed through complete sprint. I found every time I looked into it our progress was going down and down so I stopped looking into it.</p><p>According to me 'Retrospective Meeting' was another grilling session in which we were forced to reflect on our last sprint. Team answered few questions like:</p><ul class='list'><li>What went well during the sprint?</li><li>What went bad?</li><li>Where could we improve?</li></ul><p>Next sprint Cycle came and I was about to declare that I knew everything about this Scrum, there came a twist.</p><p>Sprint Planning was the missing part of the puzzle. Again, another meeting session came in which we looked into huge amount of work called Product backlog and prioritize the items and then stories were allocated to the user.</p><p>As you can see basically Scrum means: a never ending cycle of meetings and work.</p><p>To summarize, one cannot learn SCRUM until one dives into it. Every day meetings, fortnightly deliveries takes a toll on all individuals but despite this one needs to wrap it up.</p>",

Developer's and reviewer's job became easy when Microsoft introduced automatic tools for code analysis. These utilities cover all aspects of code analysis &amp; review.</p><p>We feel that logical code review can only be done by people who know requirements very well of the proposed system in development. Currently reviewers just need to focus on logical review with respect to requirements of the application. As other aspects of code review and analysis can be done with the help of 'Code Analysis' feature of Visual Studio.</p><p>The feature is available in Visual Studio 2012 or above, VS 2010 Premium and VS 2010 Ultimate editions.</p><p>The Visual Studio Code Analysis feature helps developers to find out performance, security, designing, exception management, globalization &amp; other problems to improve the Code Quality. Code Analysis can be performed on a complete solution or a specific project in the solution.</p><p>To perform Code Analysis, open your solution in VS 2012, expand ANALYZE tab on the menu bar &amp; select Run Code Analysis on Solution as shown below.<br><br><img alt=''src='../images/blog_1.jpg' class='centerdImages'></p><p>We would see a new 'Code Analysis' tab adjacent to 'Solution Explorer' tab (see below).</p><p><img alt='' src='../images/blog_2.jpg' style='width: 350px; height: 279px;' class='centerdImages'></p><p>In this example we can see two records (Errors + Warnings) in the window with the same code (CA2214) in two separate files (Employee.cs &amp; Trip.cs). Resultant list can be further filtered by searching keywords in 'Search' text box.</p><p>In order to see the detail, just select the Message, it would expand itself &amp; also highlight the piece of code against which this warning is generated. For each message a developer can take certain actions (Copy, Create a Work Item, Suppress Message) by Right Click or by pressing the Action link.</p><p><img alt='' src='../images/blog_3.jpg' class='centerdImages'></p><p>To Configure Code Analysis for a specific project or for the complete solution, <strong>Right Click</strong> on the selected project or solution, select Properties &amp; then select <strong>Code Analysis</strong>. In this window developer can set Configurations (Debug, Release, All) &amp; Platform (Any CPU, X64 etc.) settings and can also select a Rule Set or Multiple Rules Sets for the Code Analysis from default rule set list as shown below.

The OS will not be based on Linux kernel and it is completely independent from android. Its kernel will be designed for only specific purpose and it is only possible by building the operating system on micro-kernel so Google has designed its own micro-kernel named <span class='boldText'>Magenta</span>.</p><img src='../images/fuchsia_os.png' class='centerdImages' alt='Fuchsia Operating System' /><p>Like embedded systems, mobile applications do not need to rely on complete OS for specific tasks to perform. Fuchsia will be considered as real-time operating system because it will be having the unified features of android OS and chrome OS.</p><h2>Why is it so lightweight?</h2><p>Google has already developed two operating systems, Android and Chrome OS, but both are based on Linux Kernel which follows modular monolithic approach. Linux kernel bears lots of issues like system is assembled from different component and these components work together reliably but processing becomes slow.</p><p>In <span class='boldText'>monolithic</span> type of architecture, all the basic services of operating system like management of memory, management of processes and handling the interrupts etc are packaged into a single module within the kernel space. This type of architecture leads to some serious drawbacks like huge kernel size, poor maintenance which means when there is a need to add some extra feature or fixing of bugs, the whole kernel needs to be recompiled again.<span class='boldText'>[3]</span></p><img src='../images/fuchsia_os_description.png' class='centerdImages' alt='Fuchsia Operating System' /><p><span class='boldText'>Micro-kernels </span>resolve the problem of growing size of kernels. In this type of kernel architecture, basic services of operating system like device driver management, protocol stack, file system etc. run into single user space. This reduces the code size of the kernel and also increases the security and stability of OS. Apart from this, if one of the basic services crashes or gets corrupted, other basic services would work properly. All the basic operating system services which are built-in part of the user space are made to run as servers which are used by other programs in the system through inter process communication (IPC).<span class='boldText'>[3]</span><p>Fuchsia OS utilizes the <span class='boldText'>Magenta</span> micro-kernel to control the most basic hardware functions by inter-process communication. Micro-kernels are better than monolithic kernels in terms of performance and process management. Magenta is built for modern computers, having fast processors, reduced amount of RAM and arbitrary peripherals doing open ended communication.<span class='boldText'>[3]</span></p><h2>The first look of Fuchsia smartphones</h2><p>Fuchsia interface and apps are written with <span class='boldText'>Google's Flutter SDK</span>. Flutter is mobile SDK which is used for building iOS and android applications from a single code base. It is like Google's widget framework for apps that is written in Dart which gives better performance from those most of the android applications which are written with java. Flutter's another design target is to provide high performance app which can run ideally 120 frames per second <span class='boldText'>[2]</span>.</p><img src='../images/fuchsia_os_first_ui.png' class='centerdImages' alt='Fuchsia Operating System User Interface' /><p>The User Interface of Fuchsia is called <span class='boldText'>Armadillo</span>. Armadillo interface is like series of cards on wide home screen which represent apps and fuchsia smart phones will be having only single home button which will work like window manager. Back and Recent app buttons will missing in these smart phones.<span class='boldText'>[5]</span></p><p>In the center there will be user's profile picture which can be tapped on and it will bring a menu that is like Android Quick Settings. The top row of icon shows battery percentage, network and cellular information. Below that, there will be slider consisting volume, brightness control and icons for airplane mode, do not disturb and orientation control.<span class='boldText'>[5]</span></p><p>Above the profile section, there is a bunch of cards which represents the set of apps that work together for the users to achieve a goal. Tapping on any card will load its full screen interface and the more interesting thing is split screen mode. In split screen mode, any card can be dragged into another card, can be placed anywhere on the screen horizontally as well as vertically by long pressing or user can have tab bar on top for all the applications that are dragged into one. By tapping on any tab, user can have full screen interface of particular selected application and again by clicking on home white circle button, home screen will appear with all the cards interfaces and that combined card interface. Swapping down from bottom list of suggestions card will appear and the bottom panel of screen consists Google search bar. Tapping on it will bring up a new customized keyboard which has a new dark theme similar to G-board. But it lacks lots of features like long pressing for symbols or setting do not work.<span class='boldText'>[5]</span></p><h2>Will Fuchsia Smart Phones Replace Android phones?</h2><p>Google’s Android platform has become so popular that it is difficult to imagine the future without it. However Android's Linux kernel is deteriorated with lots of issues, but it has covered all the market and people have become so used to it that they will find difficulty to adapt new OS in their smart phones.</p><p>Security is the biggest issue for all the operating systems including Linux. While Linux has good reputation than windows but from security point of view no operating system is perfect. Hundreds of devices cause fragmentation in android because these devices use twisted version of android. Google lends its OEM and carriers and permits other devices to modify accordingly. It too causes defragmentation in the android OS as the modifications cannot be promptly administered.<span class='boldText'>[4]</span></p><p>Another problem is update problem. Google releases new android updates annually and some tinkered devices don’t support updates so users with older version of android are not able to use new customized features of android updates.<span class='boldText'>[4]</span></p><p>These issues are perfectly resolved by a new OS as the resolutions provided by them are  not the part of the  expensive patent licenses. Fuchsia OS will be having a new updated customized widget framework. It won't need regular updates and it would be safer built and optimized for today. Google will solve all fragmentation and update problems in Fuchsia and it would gainfully work in different devices.</p><p>References :-</p><ul class='list listNumber' style='word-wrap:break-word;'><li><a href=' http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/google-fuchsia-project-independent-of-android-dave-burke-explains-1696783' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'> http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/google-fuchsia-project-independent-of-android-dave-burke-explains-1696783</a></li><li><a href='https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/software/a-modern-os-from-google' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/software/a-modern-os-from-google</a></li><li><a href=' http://www.go4expert.com/articles/operating-kernel-types-kernels-t24793/ ' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>http://www.go4expert.com/articles/operating-kernel-types-kernels-t24793/ </a></li><li><a href='http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/138518-google-fuchsia-os-what-s-the-story-so-far' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'> http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/138518-google-fuchsia-os-what-s-the-story-so-far</a></li><li><a href='https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/googles-fuchsia-smartphone-os-dumps-linux-has-a-wild-new-ui/' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'> https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/googles-fuchsia-smartphone-os-dumps-linux-has-a-wild-new-ui/</a></li></ul>",

This reduces the code size of the kernel and also increases the security and stability of OS. Apart from this, if one of the basic services crashes or gets corrupted, other basic services would work properly. All the basic operating system services which are built-in part of the user space are made to run as servers which are used by other programs in the system through inter process communication (IPC).<span class='boldText'>[3]</span><p>Fuchsia OS utilizes the <span class='boldText'>Magenta</span> micro-kernel to control the most basic hardware functions by inter-process communication. Micro-kernels are better than monolithic kernels in terms of performance and process management. Magenta is built for modern computers, having fast processors, reduced amount of RAM and arbitrary peripherals doing open ended communication.<span class='boldText'>[3]</span></p><h2>The first look of Fuchsia smartphones</h2><p>Fuchsia interface and apps are written with <span class='boldText'>Google's Flutter SDK</span>. Flutter is mobile SDK which is used for building iOS and android applications from a single code base. It is like Google's widget framework for apps that is written in Dart which gives better performance from those most of the android applications which are written with java. Flutter's another design target is to provide high performance app which can run ideally 120 frames per second <span class='boldText'>[2]</span>.</p><img src='../images/fuchsia_os_first_ui.png' class='centerdImages' alt='Fuchsia Operating System User Interface' /><p>The User Interface of Fuchsia is called <span class='boldText'>Armadillo</span>. Armadillo interface is like series of cards on wide home screen which represent apps and fuchsia smart phones will be having only single home button which will work like window manager. Back and Recent app buttons will missing in these smart phones.<span class='boldText'>[5]</span></p><p>In the center there will be user's profile picture which can be tapped on and it will bring a menu that is like Android Quick Settings. The top row of icon shows battery percentage, network and cellular information. Below that, there will be slider consisting volume, brightness control and icons for airplane mode, do not disturb and orientation control.<span class='boldText'>[5]</span></p><p>Above the profile section, there is a bunch of cards which represents the set of apps that work together for the users to achieve a goal. Tapping on any card will load its full screen interface and the more interesting thing is split screen mode. In split screen mode, any card can be dragged into another card, can be placed anywhere on the screen horizontally as well as vertically by long pressing or user can have tab bar on top for all the applications that are dragged into one. By tapping on any tab, user can have full screen interface of particular selected application and again by clicking on home white circle button, home screen will appear with all the cards interfaces and that combined card interface. Swapping down from bottom list of suggestions card will appear and the bottom panel of screen consists Google search bar. Tapping on it will bring up a new customized keyboard which has a new dark theme similar to G-board. But it lacks lots of features like long pressing for symbols or setting do not work.<span class='boldText'>[5]</span></p><h2>Will Fuchsia Smart Phones Replace Android phones?</h2><p>Google’s Android platform has become so popular that it is difficult to imagine the future without it. However Android's Linux kernel is deteriorated with lots of issues, but it has covered all the market and people have become so used to it that they will find difficulty to adapt new OS in their smart phones.</p><p>Security is the biggest issue for all the operating systems including Linux. While Linux has good reputation than windows but from security point of view no operating system is perfect. Hundreds of devices cause fragmentation in android because these devices use twisted version of android. Google lends its OEM and carriers and permits other devices to modify accordingly. It too causes defragmentation in the android OS as the modifications cannot be promptly administered.<span class='boldText'>[4]</span></p><p>Another problem is update problem. Google releases new android updates annually and some tinkered devices don’t support updates so users with older version of android are not able to use new customized features of android updates.<span class='boldText'>[4]</span></p><p>These issues are perfectly resolved by a new OS as the resolutions provided by them are  not the part of the  expensive patent licenses. Fuchsia OS will be having a new updated customized widget framework. It won't need regular updates and it would be safer built and optimized for today. Google will solve all fragmentation and update problems in Fuchsia and it would gainfully work in different devices.</p><p>References :-</p><ul class='list listNumber' style='word-wrap:break-word;'><li><a href=' http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/google-fuchsia-project-independent-of-android-dave-burke-explains-1696783' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'> http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/google-fuchsia-project-independent-of-android-dave-burke-explains-1696783</a></li><li><a href='https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/software/a-modern-os-from-google' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/software/a-modern-os-from-google</a></li><li><a href=' http://www.go4expert.com/articles/operating-kernel-types-kernels-t24793/ ' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>http://www.go4expert.com/articles/operating-kernel-types-kernels-t24793/ </a></li><li><a href='http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/138518-google-fuchsia-os-what-s-the-story-so-far' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'> http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/138518-google-fuchsia-os-what-s-the-story-so-far</a></li><li><a href='https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/googles-fuchsia-smartphone-os-dumps-linux-has-a-wild-new-ui/' class='internalLinkColor' ng-click='scrollToTop()' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'> https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/googles-fuchsia-smartphone-os-dumps-linux-has-a-wild-new-ui/</a></li></ul>",
